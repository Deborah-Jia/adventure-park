        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a tremendus year for me with so many unexpected (wanted or not) changes for me. I was pushed not to think too much or plan for the long-term, but rather live at the moment, focus on what is important, fix it asap and leave the analysis &amp; rumination to a later stage. I was also lucky enough to make a bunch of new friends, with whom I had so many common and enthusiastic topics with and I opened my heart and become so open-minded. looking back, I gained so much but also lost some. As we say in Chinese, those gained are what you deserve and lost are those that doesn’t belong to you.</p><h2><span id="health-amp-lifestyle">Health &amp; Lifestyle</span><a href="#health-amp-lifestyle" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>feel sorry to say but eating &amp; sleeping well remains a problem for me. I maintained the awful habit of staying up late (or the whole night), getting up around noon and it repeats itself the next day. Due to this poor sleeping habit, I always skip breakfast or even lunch, so most of the time I only had one meal. I am still young so I am still heathy, catching one cold each winter and can get healed with no medicine. But if I constantly have this poor lifestyle there is always sickness potential. The only comfort is that my sleeping quality is awsome as always, 8+ hours with no interruptin is never a problem. I sitll hope that I can be at bed before 11PM and get bed early around 7 AM.</p><p>This year I still didn’t form the habit of frequent exercise. I lost the capability to jog from the early 20s. so to recover it I started talking a long walk every day, by setting a calorie burning daily goal on Apple Fitness. It worked sometimes and sometime didn’t, mostly depending on my freetime and if I was accompnied by someone else. Also it helps if there are fine events insted of just radom walking. I really enjoy the moments when I chat aimlessly with my friends while walking by the Duna riverbank, and finding mini statues through every corner of the city.</p><p>body weight, along with BMI can be a realible indicator of health. I gained some weight after finishing CFA level II exam and spending relentlessly in Chinese restaurant. And my body weight reached a record high after I went back to China for home visit. Homemade food, bubble tea, snacks, my grandma’s concern that I was starving overseas, yum. Luckily, having wisdom tooth pulled gave me back some days of abstinence. and later on skipping meals helped me scale down many of my weights. I magically lost 33 pounds, reahcing a relavantly heathier BMI of 25.5. New year new me, still need to work hard on this.</p><p>The annual health check happened in May and I did several gyganchologist check later on, all with good result. Looks like I got some really good genes from the female side of my family. From the consultation with my doctors, it looks like family sickness history, allegies, lifestyle (coffee, smoke &amp; drinking) and exercise are the predominant factors of health status. keep it up.</p><p>For the concerns of teeth health, skin aging and body weight, I cut down sugar intake this year, and with the encouragement of my friend Shengshifu, I even reduced deep fried food. I hope next year I will focus more on homemade salad and seafood. As mentioned by her, one of my good traits is that I really have a light flavor of meals and I avoid putting too much salt in food. Keep it up.</p><p>Next year, hope I can become an early riser (11-7), eat healthier food and do more jogging.</p><h2><span id="mental-amp-emotion">Mental &amp; Emotion</span><a href="#mental-amp-emotion" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>As a typical HSP, I always care way too much about others and the environment instead of focuing on myself. I was easily impacted by the words, facial expression and behaviors of people around me. I once thought it would be good if I lock myself at home and focus on personal business, but in the past 2 years studying for an exam deteriorated the situation. Being isolated from the society only made myself more sensitive and less sensible.</p><p>I sometimes wonder, am I a real introverted? I enjoy small scale social events most of the time, and I am energized by giving public speaking. My dark humor always makes people laugh (one friend even say that his first amusement of the day always comes from my Wechat Moments #微信朋友圈). I did the MBTI test again and found out that I changed from ISTJ (the Logistician) to ENFJ (Protagonist). Interestingly, I always get different result depending on the languge used for the test and my location inside or outside China. Perhaps my friend also impacted me as she is also ENFJ.</p><p>As a person who is always learning how to be kind to myself and love myself more, I am always on the road to self-exploration. The path is spiral and I keep rising. One biggest achievement this year is that I confronted rumination and tried not to get dorwned in it. I used to believe that every problrm that pomps up needs to be solved, by reading the book <em>rumination</em> I realized sometimes it’s just an intrusive thought and all I need to do is to ignore. Just keep going and focus on the present and the most important. With the help of pistachio ice cream, salami pizza, Thai massage and spending time with my favorite person, I am mostly relaxed and successfully unwind. Here I am grateful for all the kind people I have met this year. You lit my lives.</p><p>Work gave me most emotional turmoil this year: one is the unexpected team turnover; another is being forced to get involved in an unwanted task. My problem is that I can be way too considerate and kind to people who do appreciate it at all. <em>A man swealth is his own ruin by causing other’s greed.</em> I am not the type of person who complains too much on a daily basis, especially when all I wanted is emotional support. Once I started to reiterate, that means I am seeking real solution and want to tackle it seriously. Through these two major situationship, I realized the best way for me to calm down and do what I can, ask help if necessary, instead of anticipating too much about the future.</p><p>I am learning to just say no feeling no guilty, and have made 2 progresses at the year end. It was hard when I am going throught this, but at later stage I feel no shame at all, and thanked myself for such insistence. I am slow to react, but I react.</p><p>I still felt stressful for low-probability things during this year: first worring too much about my cavities, then possible failure of malpractice in the dental surgery, though I live in a city that’s been called word-of-the mouth dental capital of Europe. It turned out to be very successful where I couldn’t even feel any pain after anesthetic went away (I started to not hate local public care that much). Then, I spent huge amount of time worrying about abdominal pain, which I recovered immediately after I went back home for holidays (could just be led by unhealthy lifesle). And, in early December, worrying too much about another unwellness again which turned out to be complete nonsense.  All in all, those unhealthy lifesyle make me fell bad, which led to emotional stress and deteriorated the situation. I didn’t even realize this viscious cycle till I wrote here.</p><p>One positive change I had this year is that I finally admit that I am one of the normal people who can sometimes feel or fear loneliness too. Previously I always denied the existence of it and denied people who admit such existence or did silly things simply to cure sense of lonliness. It is ok to feel lonely, and I am lucky enough to make a lot of new friends with deep talks. They are like dadelion seeds, scattering in the backyard of my garden, bringing me eneless joyce.</p><p>They say that hapiness comes from comparison and I never doubt it. But with who? One of my goose friend’s thoughts really surprized me and makes me guilty when he said he is happy with friends’ success. Right, The true nobility is in being superior to your previous self. Focusing too much on other people’s seemingly superior life will only make you drowned. It’s just a landscape.</p><h2><span id="life-amp-experience">Life &amp; experience</span><a href="#life-amp-experience" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>I resumed travelling this year. My last job forced me to travell too much and for a while I thought it would be much better to saty at home. But I do enjoyed the trip to Vienna, which allowed me to unwind. especially when I encoutered so many interesting people and surprises. I still remember the stranger photographer’s son and another stranger boy we attracted when she took a photo for me (check “Golden Summer”)</p><p>Playing video games on a consol is another trial I had this year. I was under a lot of stress this Spring and my friend persuaded me to try video games. I was quite resistent from the beginning, knowingly because of the toxic and ignorant teaching from past experience that playing video games is useless. But why do we have to always do meaningful stuff? who defines what is valuable? I bought XSS and subscribed to XGP for 6 months. For all the games I played, I love Assassin’s Creed Origins the most, and the second best is Hitman 47 delux edition. I prefer games that requires a strategy to kill instead of confronting your enemy and kill (sounds really like my personality).</p><p>I started dating again and found my favorite person (so far). We had a lot of meaningful conversations and he is a great listener (at least) trying to be open-minded. We two together hunted a lot of mini statues of Budapest and travelled too. My friends said being in a romantic relationship compltely changed me from Amy to Bernadette, I laughed and refuted that becuase you folks never know me previously lol.</p><p>The most meaningful experience this year is passing CFA level II exam. It’s more than the exam result, but rather that I pass the test I have for myself: I am able to do difficult things among challenges, and I constantly enjoy achievement. It is my self-refelction and mindfullness that makes it a values journey. Meanwhile I made an important decision that I gave up on studying for level III as I am determined not to work in Finance in the forseeable future. This industry is attractive, but not for me. With this decision I resumede the study of data science and started some practice sessions, and wanted to initiate some data analuysis project on Kaggle.</p><p>The biggest (yet unexpected) takeaway is the positive decision of permanent residence. I didn’t expect that it will arrive so soon. Gaining PR gives me more vocatinal flexibility and freedom to choose where I wanna stay.</p><p>Compared with the start of this year, I am apparently happier (many thanks to my dearest friends again) and no longer feel Sunday blue. Hope next year I will still hang out with all these friends more, enjoying the good food, art and museum altogether in Europe.</p><p>(gosh till this moment I feel I will never finish this year-end review…)</p><h2><span id="financial">Financial</span><a href="#financial" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>emmm not too convient to say here, but I am saving to buy a flat. I was focus on PR application which doesn’t encourage proactive investment so my investment activies in this country is quite lame. I will invest more in ETF next year let’s put it that way.</p><h2><span id="interpersonal">Interpersonal</span><a href="#interpersonal" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>My mom bought a new flat in the city so this year I finally got the chance to spend plenty of quality time with my grandma. My grandma has all the awsome traits of her generation in China: hardworking, industrious, never complains and cherish families. She is very hardworking: Wake up at 5 o’clock, cook, wake me up for breakfast, wash all the dishes, wash all the clothes by hand, walk out to buy groceries, continue to cook and wash dishes. In the evening, go out to dance in the square. I took her to a short trip in the neighboring city where we hiked for 2 days but she reamined energetic - gosh she is 81 year old. Still! My grandma loves fried chicken (both wings and nuggets!) and burgers, enjoys bubble tea and loves walking and travelling. I wish I can hold such passion and enthusiam about life, confronting chellenges and defying turbulence in a ruthless manner like her.</p><p>I came to know 10+ people this year and among them 6-7 become really close friends. I tried live chat room but was quite disappointed with Chinese guys (arrogant as always) there. Then I move to Bumble BFF mode and made a really good friend there who even invited me to a Xmas party with locals only. Other friends are made from net-work - this is the good thing about being and knowing extroverts, you know one, you know all. I was so surprised that I made so many real friends and had quality time with them. And I appreciate they spent time with me. Let’s share love, care and calories.</p><p>Still, I am not the kind of person who prone to confront conflicts. I filter people instead of giving lectures. But still I learnt to react instead of using too much time reliveing and analysing the situation before having any reactions. I admit that I place feelings in front of judgement. And in real life experience I do find that in certain occasions I simply cannot talk more in front of people I feel uneasy with; meanwhile in those people I feel safe and sound with, I become so creative and ideas sprkle. Admiting the existence of vibes makes it much easier to make new friends. If a person makes me feel uncomfortable, I leave. And I believe there will always be comfort zone for me instead of sticking to the wrong people.</p><p>but overall, the degress of mental conflicts decreased a lot this year, pehaps because I made way too many good friends and their involvement in my life gets me too busy to conduct any unnecessary mindfulness. To be honest, evening being alone I was watching the series recommended by my extroverted friends.</p><h2><span id="mindset">Mindset</span><a href="#mindset" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>One of the best midset I learnt this year is to  stop delieberately gettting immersed in things of secondary importance. Just do it. I used to be a person that plan perfectly before any movement and as long as I am sidetracked, I do what I can to get back to the original plan. Now I learnt to take the first step and obseve and edit as soon as there is progress. Practice is the best learning experience. By doing so I found that all the fears and anxieties are gone, and what I anticipated as insurmountable turned out to be not threaenting at all. Also, “doing things for 5 mins only” is a great way to kill procrastination as once I started, the thing turned out to be not troublesome at all and I enjoy doing so. I tackled a lot of small things.</p><p>Another mindset that I like is that dont be afraid of bad things as good things will happen thereafter to reach internal balance and do not care too much about trivialities in life. From my childhood I was always taught and disciplined to treat little things with great care, even if these were completely nonsense and unnecessary. The power of rumination is so strong, even if I tried I still focused too much on bad memories. I am still working hard to shake them off. Maybe this is a random walk, but as long as I keep walking, there will be a change.</p><p>Skillset &amp; Learning curve</p><p>One of the best skills I learnt this year is the building of this blog website using blog framework with the help of my friend <a href="https://sgzerolc.github.io/sg/about/">Sam Li</a>. I was only trying to create something fun as I enjoyed coding and building new things a lot. But I never expect it to be so useful and almost become a major achievement of this year. I encouraged myself to have more inputs and outputs so as to display on the website. This is a strong motivation which pushes me to create more. I also asked my friends’ opinions to use their photos on my website as illustrations which conntected me and friends even more.</p><p>From the perspective of reading, I finished 6 books this year and am still reading 2, all fictional ones. Comapred with 30+ books last year, I still read a lot as one of the books I am reading is way too long (around 4 million Chinese characters, taking 100+ hours to finish). Counting the numbers or hours soley doesn’t make sense. The most valuable one is Did Miss Zhu fall into a trap today and I really like it as a Electronic literature 网文. This is an interesting book talking how a woman dressed up as a man and thrived in the political environment where women are not encouraged to recevie education and are not allowed to work. She was a complete self-made woman and became a prime minister of the country. Immediately she revealed she is actually a woman, and quit her position and become a landloard of one of the areas of the country. I was so surprized of the quality of such literature, then was motivated by this lady. Just get started, fosing on solving the issues and the situation will change.</p><p>I wanted to take more courses on Coursera but due to the drama my subscription was canceled. So I went back to Datacamp for Data Engineering and Data Science tracks. The engineering coures appear to be very boring so I paused and went to Data Science ones. Those are of great help to build step-by-step knowledge as I never learnt python systametically back to Uni. Those courses along with practice sessions allow me to learn from the scrach and understand how after know what it is. I love the sequence of learning list, array, dictionary and data frame. I am still struggling with slicing and selection and sure will get the hang of it. In the near future, I plan to leverage the databases on Kaggle and do more data analysis project and post those on this website.</p><h2><span id="the-personal-touch">The Personal Touch</span><a href="#the-personal-touch" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><ol><li><h3><span id="snowuary">Snowuary</span><a href="#snowuary" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p><a href="../../../../../Downloads/IMG_4611.HEIC">IMG_4611.HEIC</a></p><p>Foggy Budapest where I returned home from a one-person celebration of my biggest exam pass.</p></li><li><p>Shortest Month</p></li><li><p>Spring Awakens</p></li><li><p>Blossom Month</p></li><li><p>May Flowers</p></li><li><p>Longest Days</p></li><li><p>Sunburst Month</p></li><li><p>Golden Summer</p></li><li><p>Fall’s Whisper</p></li><li><p>Crunchy Leaves</p></li><li><p>Frosty Mornings</p></li><li><p>Holiday Cheer</p></li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First and foremost, I give all credits of this website building to my study partner <a href="https://sgzerolc.github.io/sg/about/">OLC</a> who has always encouraged me to buid my own zone and offered treemendous help in initiating, testing, and wrapping up the first version of this website. @OLC, Thanks so much! without you, this personal blogging would just be a blueprint with no progress.</p><h2><span id="what-i-like-abt-this-website">What I like abt this website</span><a href="#what-i-like-abt-this-website" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><ol><li>Ofc, ZERO cost literally, incl. customised Domain Name (like my adventure-park), themes changing (as long as it’s available on Hexo), the way you post the blogs (wether it’s pure text or with pictures) and so forth.</li><li>No Censorship. You can write whatever you want without worrying your content being censored. <em>The website is you oyster.</em></li><li>Writing is offline and only needs the Internet when posting, which means you will always have stable back-ups in case of accidents.</li><li>Some posts do not need to go public - you can use a simple function <em>hidden: true</em> to hide posts you would like to be seen only by yourself and share such only to your closed ones if you would like to.</li></ol><h2><span id="what-is-required-to-build-it">What is required to build it</span><a href="#what-is-required-to-build-it" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><ol><li>Basic knowledge of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/git/">git</a> and Mac OS Terminal/Windows Shell</li><li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account</li><li>Basic understanding of <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> would be preffered.</li></ol><h2><span id="what-is-hexo-and-why-do-you-need-it">What is HEXO  and why do you need it</span><a href="#what-is-hexo-and-why-do-you-need-it" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>The website is built using <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>, a friendly and popular blog framework. Nobody wants to reinvent the wheel if there’re already tools available 😉 You can check <a href="https://hexo.io/docs/">documentation</a> for more info.
