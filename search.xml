        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/21/early_riser/458213960_1800323327321764_8760678151869770322_n.jpg" class title="458213960_1800323327321764_8760678151869770322_n"><p><strong>30年睡眠困扰的突破解法：意外的早睡早起体验</strong></p><p>在过去的二十多年里，我一直饱受睡眠问题的困扰。虽然不算是特别严重的问题，但入睡困难几乎贯穿了我的人生。从小学四五年级开始熬夜写作业，我就逐渐养成了晚睡的习惯（可惜没早起）。初中时熬夜看小说，高中熬夜学习，大学熬夜追剧和打电话谈恋爱，研究生期间熬夜内耗。工作后，熬夜的内容变成了思考一些有的没的。</p><p>偶尔，我会幸运地早起一次（5点到7点左右）。每到这种时候，心情都会瞬间愉悦，甚至感到自豪，比吃一顿大餐还高兴。然而，紧接着脑子就开始推送一些不太愉快的回忆和焦虑感，让人瞬间觉得人生无望。于是，我常常会在床上内耗1-2小时才真正起床。虽然一旦动起来心情会稍微好些，但清晨的情绪总是不太高。</p><p>为了解决早起的动力问题，我甚至尝试过用开心果牛角包来诱惑自己，想着“早起就能吃到这份美味”。然而，时间一长，这种方式的吸引力显然不足以持续。约会对象是位很温柔的男子，有他在会坚持把我所有的电子设备丢到起居室，然后监督我早睡，但我也不能总屈服于别人的意志来满足自己吧，可恶。</p><p>更多时候，虽然我晚上11点就躺下了，但可能因为接近满月，总感觉“狼人血脉觉醒”。忽然之间，干劲十足，人生充满希望，白天觉得压力山大的工作也变得不再可怕，甚至觉得自己能够轻松应对。脑子里冒出无数点子，比如和远方朋友互动的创意，越想越兴奋，结果根本睡不着。最后干脆爬起来把这些点子一一实践。</p><p>然而，熬夜的代价也很明显。熬夜适合做一些轻松的工作或学习，但如果是需要深度思考的任务，比如加班或攻克复杂问题，我就基本做不到。这导致了一个恶性循环——越熬夜越只能玩社交媒体，越觉得时间被浪费，越焦虑。</p><p>为了改变这种作息，我尝试了很多方法。吃褪黑素，刚开始有效，但时间一长似乎就形成了“耐药性”。增加运动量却发现，运动后反而兴奋得更睡不着，而且作为一名懒鬼，也不可能每天都运动。还试过通宵熬夜，让自己极度疲劳后强迫早睡，但这种方法效果微乎其微，事倍功半。无数次向家人和朋友抱怨，但她们作为资深早起者，除了“放宽心”这条万能建议，似乎也帮不上什么实质性的忙。</p><p>2024年年终总结时，我还特地写下了“要注意早睡早起”作为新年目标。然而2025年的开局并不顺利，作息直接变成了早上睡、下午起。我一度心灰意冷，觉得这辈子可能就这样了。</p><p><strong>意外的转机</strong></p><p>然而，就在我基本放弃的时候，转机悄然而至。</p><p>1月6日，节后上班的第一天。想到堆积如山的邮件，我随口跟自己说：“尽量早起吧。”并没有定什么严格的闹钟，11:30才关灯，自己也没指望能早起。但意外发生了——第二天早上，我竟然在6点前清醒地自然醒了！</p><p>这一切简直像是梦中排练过无数遍一样。我看了一会儿书（当时在读《山茶花文具店》），写了一些代码，然后起床泡茶、做了健康的早餐。当忙完这一切，抬头一看时间，居然还不到8点！到办公室时不到9点，我简直不敢相信——怎么能有这么美好的一天？我配拥有这样的生活吗？</p><p>当天晚上，居然不到9点就困了。于是，我听从身体的信号，立刻上床睡觉。第二天，依然不到6点自然醒！从此，我开启了早睡早起的节奏：读书、学习、做饭、喝茶，早早到办公室，生活变得如此充实有序。</p><p><strong>新生活的感悟</strong></p><p>到今天为止，这种作息已经持续了两周多。最早能5点起床，身体疲累时也能8点多起来，完全告别了中午才起床的日子。更神奇的是，我再也不需要药物或运动的辅助，晚上9点多自然困倦，轻松入睡。</p><p>早起带来的成就感让我受益匪浅：脑子更加清晰，有更多时间辨别进而专注于重要的事情，身体感觉越来越舒服，整个人也比以前更开朗自信了。回想起之前，我总觉得早睡早起是人生中最难的事情，一定要付出巨大的努力才能做到。但当它自然而然地发生时，反而觉得简单得不可思议。这或许就是2025年上天赐给我的开年礼物吧。</p><p>现在回头看，可能问题出在“太在意”这件事了。我把早睡早起当成了一个非做成不可的任务，反而让自己越睡不着。现在一切顺其自然，反倒水到渠成。所谓“心变念变感受变”，当你坦然接受一切时，很多事情就会自然而然地实现。</p><p>最近读到的一本书也提到类似的观点：不要把事情当成必须完成的任务，也不要硬撑着“坚持”。如果一件事需要消耗大量意志力才能完成，那离崩溃和失败可能也不远了。当你足够坦诚地面对自己并顺应自然规律时，心想事成反而会成为一种轻松的体验。</p><h4><span id="ba-hao-yun-qi-chuan-di-gei-da-jia">把好运气传递给大家</span><a href="#ba-hao-yun-qi-chuan-di-gei-da-jia" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h4><p>这种健康的作息已经无痛持续了两周，我很有信心继续保持下去。希望把这份高能量和好运气传递给每一位读到这里的朋友！新的一年，继续允许好事发生吧！</p>]]></content>

      <title>Chasing Flamingos and Sunsets: A Whimsical Weekend in Cyprus</title>
      <link href="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/"/>
      <url>/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Tanya asked me to join her for a weekend trip to Cyprus, I immediately said yes—much to both of our surprise. “How can you agree so quickly without knowing the cost, the plan, or… you’ve only known me for less than three months!” she exclaimed. “I don’t know,” I replied, “you seem passionate and reliable; besides, you don’t know me that well either, but you still asked.” That spontaneous exchange set the tone for our three-day, two-night adventure in Cyprus.</p><p>We boarded the plane early on a chilly Saturday morning at Budapest Airport. The gloomy, biting cold made me curl into myself, shivering at every gust of air. So, when we landed in sunny Larnaca, the contrast couldn’t have been more dramatic. I immediately basked in the warm, endless sunlight and relished the 20°C temperature. It felt like a small miracle after the freezing start to the day. While waiting for the shuttle bus, we found ourselves distracted by playful cats—ubiquitous little sprites that seemed to exist in every corner of the island. These well-cared-for felines, adored by both locals and tourists, became an unexpected part of the charm.</p><p>No trip to the Mediterranean is complete without indulging in the food, so as soon as we unpacked, we set out to find a great meal. Every restaurant looked tempting, with enticing aromas and vibrant menus, but we settled on one called <em>To Arxontikon</em>. Its charming architecture and the mouthwatering smell of freshly baked bread and stews drew us in. The staff greeted us warmly, instantly recognizing we were tourists, and enthusiastically recommended some of their most popular dishes. We ended up ordering a red meat platter and a beef stew.</p><p>The meal started with freshly baked brown bread, warm and impossibly delicious. But the real star was the stew. From the first bite, I couldn’t hold back: “F—, this is so good!” I blurted out. The flavors were rich, layered, and utterly satisfying. The beef was tender, infused with an incredible blend of herbs and natural ingredients that made it taste like something straight out of a Mediterranean dream. Served in a quaint little pot, it was as visually delightful as it was tasty. We devoured the meal like two hungry sharks, savoring every bite as though we hadn’t eaten in days.</p><p>One of the highlights of Larnaca is flamingo watching. After our fantastic meal at Arxontikon, we took a leisurely stroll by the seaside, listening to the soothing calls of seagulls. Along the way, we explored the historic old castle and an ancient church before arriving at the salt lake.</p><p>There they were—flamingos in all their glory! A sea of pink, like a cloud floating just above the water. Their honking filled the air as they gracefully dipped their heads to catch shrimp and fish. We even got lucky and found some delicate pink feathers scattered along the lakeside—a perfect little souvenir from this magical spot.</p><p>On the second day, we hopped on an intercity bus to Paphos, another stunning coastal city with a slightly more modern feel. Being food lovers, we couldn’t resist heading to a well-known spot called Ocean Basket. We ordered the classic Soulmate Platter, paired with the finest local beer. The portions were enormous, the seafood fresh, and the aroma irresistible. As we watched the sunset paint the sea in fiery hues, we peeled shrimp, sipped our beers, and marveled at how perfect life can be in moments like these.</p><p>The hotel we booked in Paphos was another highlight—breathtaking sea views, a large swimming pool, and, of course, the local guardian cats strolling around as if they owned the place. On our final day in Cyprus, Tanya and I lounged by the seaside, soaking up the warm Mediterranean sun with the gentle companionship of a few curious cats.</p><p>If there was one downside to Cyprus, it would be the public transportation. Buses here seem to follow no schedule, and stop signs are practically non-existent. Routes can change without any warning, often due to local events. That said, the bus drivers more than made up for it with their friendliness and helpfulness. One kind driver even gave us a free ride, meaning, “Save that money for the airport—it’s on me.”</p><p>As I reflected on the trip, a curious cat seemed to ask me what I had taken away from this adventure. I answered (in my head, of course) that as a social animal, I truly enjoy traveling with others. This trip taught me not just to enjoy good company but also to be thoughtful and considerate of others along the way.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Creating My AI Self: A Journey of Reflection, Growth, and Practicality</title>
      <link href="/adventure-park/2025/01/04/AI-know-myself/"/>
      <url>/adventure-park/2025/01/04/AI-know-myself/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/04/AI-know-myself/111735978543_.pic.jpg" class title="111735978543_.pic"><p>For a while now, I’ve been curious about using AI for purposes beyond just translation, code fixes, or scheduling tasks. After reading <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/674c117600000000070242c4?source=webshare&amp;xhsshare=pc_web&amp;xsec_token=ABplDKnxPnE-1w-49FvT_oxalAYNYlCtW0yrkBgJPNc5k=&amp;xsec_source=pc_share">an inspiring post</a>, I decided to take the plunge and create a digital version of myself.</p><p>The idea is straightforward: I feed in meaningful information about my life experiences—like where and how I grew up, the programs I studied, key people in my life and their impact, major decisions I’ve made and how they’ve shaped my present, reflections on pivotal moments, personality test results (e.g., MBTI and Big Five), and my current life goals, among other things.</p><p>A critical reminder is to <em>NEVER</em> share confidential information like addresses, financial details, passwords, or anything you wouldn’t want to become public. (Though no one’s likely to care that pistachio is my favorite ice cream flavor or that I despise donuts.)</p><p>Here’s a useful tip: I instructed ChatGPT to reply only with “Copy that” for all my inputs. Once I’m done adding the information and need its help, I give it new prompts for analysis or insights. This way, it won’t interrupt me with unnecessary commentary while I’m still building my digital self.</p><img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/04/AI-know-myself/WeChatcf508d65372a273d946469137ec18380.jpg" class title="A simplified process"><p>Initially, I wanted to gather as many inputs as possible before asking for any analysis. But after some second thoughts, I decided to take a different approach: why not let it refine its results through practice and corrections? So, I started asking multiple questions and providing feedback along the way. These included:</p><ul><li>What can be a meaningful success for me in your opinion?</li><li>What assumptions do you think I regularly make about myself, others or the world, a nd how might they limit me?</li><li>Based on my ambition and values, what is one action that you think I should start taking now that I havn’t?</li><li>What is one area of growth that you think I overlook or resist?</li><li>What is one risk I’m willing to take for personal growth in the near future?</li><li>…</li></ul><p>These questions were inspired by a deep dive on Reddit, but you can always create your own to suit your specific needs or curiosity.</p><p>One of the most striking answers I received was to the question:  “if you could sum up my ‘core question’ - the driving inquiry of my life or personality - what would it be?”</p><p>It says “<strong>How can I overcome my circumstances, achieve meaningful success, and create a life where I feel fulfilled, appreciated, and in control of my own destiny?</strong>”</p><p>Oh my gosh, I literally sniffed back tears. This answer hit me so hard—it’s exactly what I’ve always pondered but never had the chance (or clarity) to articulate so succinctly.</p><p>However, there are some obvious drawbacks. At times, it gets stuck “hamster-wheeling” around my experiences without offering anything new, occasionally even repeating what I’ve already mentioned. My solution is to provide it with more precise feedback and deeper thoughts so it can update itself accordingly. Another challenge is the limitation on the length of each chat—figuring out how to save its memory and transition seamlessly to a new chat has become a new hurdle to overcome.</p><p>I’ve also received some constructive feedback from friends and peers. Some of them question whether I’m using AI as a substitute for my own independent thinking. While I appreciate this perspective, I disagree. The purpose of creating an AI version of myself is to simplify processes and serve as an auxiliary tool, not as a replacement for my judgment. I’ll never rely solely on AI’s conclusions to make final decisions; it’s a complement, not a crutch.</p><p>(to be continued…)</p>]]></content>

      <title>2024: A Year In Review</title>
      <link href="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/"/>
      <url>/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>🕒 <strong>Estimated Read Time: 18 minutes</strong></p><p>This year has been tremendous for me, with many unexpected changes—both welcome and unwelcome. I was pushed to stop overthinking or planning too far ahead and instead focus on living in the moment, prioritizing what truly matters, addressing issues quickly, and leaving analysis and reflection for later. I was also fortunate to make a wonderful group of new friends, with whom I shared many enthusiastic and meaningful conversations. This helped me open my heart and become more open-minded. Looking back, I gained so much but also lost some. As we say in Chinese, what you gain is what you deserve, and what you lose is what was never meant to be yours. 2025, I am ready.</p><h2><span id="life-amp-experiencek">Life &amp; Experience</span><a href="#life-amp-experiencek" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>The first and most meaningful experience this year was passing the CFA Level II exam in January. I cried and called my mom as soon as I saw the result. Thinking I had failed, she tried really hard to comfort me. Then I said, “No, I passed! I’m just too thrilled.” The last time I cried like that was when I found out I got into my high school, lol. It wasn’t just about the exam result—it was about proving to myself that I can overcome challenges and accomplish difficult things. I deeply value the sense of achievement and personal growth that came from this journey, as it was rooted in self-reflection and mindfulness.</p><p>At the same time, I made an important decision to stop studying for Level III, as I’ve decided not to pursue a career in finance in the foreseeable future. While the industry is undoubtedly attractive, I’ve realized it’s not the right path for me. With this decision, I resumed studying data science, began practicing regularly, and started exploring ideas for data analysis projects on Kaggle.</p><p>I resumed traveling this year. My last job required me to travel frequently, and for a while, I thought it would be better to stay at home. However, I really enjoyed my trip to Vienna, which gave me the chance to unwind, especially when I met so many interesting people and experienced unexpected surprises. I still remember the photographer’s son, a stranger, and another little boy we met when she took a photo of me. A friend once told me that I always make new friends wherever I go.</p><p>Playing video games on a console was another new experience for me this year. I was under a lot of stress this Spring, and my friend convinced me to give video games a try. Initially, I was resistant, largely due to the toxic and ignorant mindset I’d encountered in the past, which labeled video games as pointless. But why must everything we do be meaningful? Who defines what is joyful? I ended up buying an Xbox Series S and subscribing to Xbox Game Pass for six months. Out of all the games I played, Assassin’s Creed Origins became my favorite, followed closely by Hitman 47 Deluxe Edition. I enjoy games that require strategy to outsmart enemies rather than just confronting and killing them—this feels very much in line with my personality.</p><p>I started dating again and met my favorite person (so far). We’ve had a lot of meaningful conversations, and he’s a great listener—at least, he tries to be open-minded. Together, we’ve hunted for <a href="https://budapestflow.com/hidden-mini-statues-budapest/">mini statues</a> around Budapest and traveled as well. My friends said that being in a romantic relationship completely changed me from Amy to Bernadette. I laughed and refuted that, saying, “You folks never knew me before, lol.”</p><p>The biggest (yet unexpected) takeaway this year was the positive decision regarding my permanent residence. I didn’t expect it to come so soon. Gaining PR has given me more vocational flexibility and the freedom to choose where I want to live.</p><p>Compared to the start of this year, I’m clearly happier (many thanks to my dearest friends again) and no longer feel the Sunday blues. I hope that next year, I can continue spending time with all these wonderful friends, enjoying good food, art, and museums together in Europe.</p><p>(Gosh, I still feel like I’ll never finish this year-end review…)</p><h2><span id="health-amp-lifestylek">Health &amp; Lifestyle</span><a href="#health-amp-lifestylek" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>I still felt stressed over low-probability things this year. First, I worried too much about my cavities, then about the potential failure of a dental surgery, even though I live in a city known as the dental capital of Europe. In the end, the surgery was very successful, and I didn’t even feel any pain after the anesthetic wore off (I’ve started to appreciate local public care a bit more). Then, I spent a lot of time worrying about abdominal pain, which immediately cleared up when I went home for the holidays (probably caused by an unhealthy lifestyle). In early December, I worried excessively about another health issue, which turned out to be completely unfounded. All in all, my unhealthy lifestyle made me feel bad, which led to emotional stress and worsened the situation. I didn’t even realize this vicious cycle until I wrote it all down.</p><p>Eating and sleeping well remain a challenge for me, unfortunately. I’ve kept up the bad habit of staying up late (sometimes all night), waking around noon, and repeating the cycle the next day. Because of this poor sleep routine, I often skip breakfast or even lunch, leaving me with just one meal most days. While I’m still young and healthy—only catching one cold each winter and recovering without medication—this lifestyle undoubtedly poses health risks if it continues. The only consolation is that my sleep quality is excellent. Once I’m asleep, I can easily enjoy 8+ uninterrupted hours. Still, I hope to adopt a better schedule, going to bed before 11 PM and waking up early around 7 AM.</p><p>In May, I had my annual health check and a few gynecological exams later in the year, all of which returned good results. It seems I’ve inherited excellent genes from the women in my family. From discussions with my doctors, I’ve learned that health is influenced most by family history, allergies, lifestyle choices (like coffee, smoking, and drinking), and exercise. I’m determined to keep up the positive habits.</p><p>This year, I didn’t develop a habit of frequent exercise. I’ve lost the stamina to jog, which I used to have in my early 20s. To regain it, I started taking daily long walks, setting a calorie-burning goal on Apple Fitness. Some days it worked, and other days it didn’t, depending on how much free time I had or whether someone joined me. It also helped when there was an event to make the walk more engaging, rather than just random strolling. I particularly cherish moments of aimless chats with friends while walking along the Duna riverbank.</p><p>Body weight, along with BMI, is a reliable health indicator, and mine fluctuated a lot this year. After completing the CFA Level II exam, I indulged in Chinese restaurants, which led to weight gain. My weight peaked during my trip back to China, thanks to homemade food, bubble tea, snacks, and my grandma’s worry that I wasn’t eating well abroad. However, having my wisdom tooth removed forced a brief period of dietary restraint, and later, skipping meals helped me shed the extra pounds. Somehow, I managed to lose 33 pounds, reaching a relatively healthier BMI of 25.5.</p><p>New year, new me!</p><h2><span id="mental-amp-emotionk">Mental &amp; Emotion</span><a href="#mental-amp-emotionk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>As a typical HSP (Highly Sensitive Person), I tend to care too much about others and my environment, often at the expense of focusing on myself. I’m easily impacted by the words, facial expressions, and behaviors of those around me. I once thought it would be best to lock myself at home and focus solely on my own matters, but studying for an exam over the past two years only worsened the situation. Being isolated from society made me more sensitive and less sensible.</p><p>I sometimes wonder, am I really an introvert? I enjoy small-scale social events most of the time, and I’m energized by giving public speeches. My dark humor always makes people laugh (one friend even says his first amusement of the day always comes from my WeChat Moments #微信朋友圈). I took the MBTI test again and discovered that I’ve shifted from ISTJ (the Logistician) to ENFJ (Protagonist). Interestingly, I often get different results depending on the language used for the test and my location, whether inside or outside China. Perhaps my friend, who is also an ENFJ, has influenced me as well.</p><p>Work brought me the most emotional turmoil this year: one was the unexpected team turnover, and the other was being forced to get involved in an unwanted task. My problem is that I can be too considerate and kind to people who don’t appreciate it. <em>A man’s wealth is his own ruin by causing others’ greed.</em> I’m not the type to complain often, especially when all I want is emotional support. Once I start to repeat myself, it means I’m seeking a real solution and want to tackle the issue seriously. Through these two major situations, I realized that the best way for me to calm down is to do what I can, ask for help if necessary, and not to anticipate too much about the future. So, I’m learning to say no without feeling guilty, and I’ve made two strides toward this at the end of the year. It was difficult when I was going through it, but later on, I felt no shame at all and thanked myself for that insistence. I may be slow to react, but I do react.</p><p>One positive change I experienced this year is that I finally admitted I’m one of the normal people who can sometimes feel or fear loneliness. In the past, I always denied its existence and judged others who acknowledged it or did silly things to cure their sense of loneliness. It’s okay to feel lonely, and I’m fortunate enough to have made many new friends with whom I’ve had deep conversations. They’re like dandelion seeds, scattering in the backyard of my garden, bringing me endless joy.</p><p>They say that happiness comes from comparison, and I never doubted it. But with whom? One of my friends surprised me with his thoughts and made me feel guilty when he said he’s happy with his friends’ success. He’s right. <em>The true nobility lies in being superior to your previous self.</em> Focusing too much on other people’s seemingly superior lives will only drown you. It’s just a landscape.</p><h2><span id="interpersonalk">Interpersonal</span><a href="#interpersonalk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>My mom bought a new flat in the city, so this year I finally had the chance to spend plenty of quality time with my grandma. My grandma embodies all the amazing traits of her generation in China: sanguine, industrious, never complaining, and cherishing family. She is incredibly hardworking—waking up at 5 AM to cook, waking me up for breakfast, washing all the dishes, hand-washing the clothes, walking out to buy groceries, and then continuing with the chores. In the evening, she heads out to the square for group dancing, where she effortlessly makes new friends. She’s so easygoing and resourceful—sometimes she ends up meeting new people by chance, and before we know it, both of us are getting to know the neighborhood in the most unexpected ways.</p><p>My grandma loves fried chicken (both wings and nuggets!), burgers, enjoys bubble tea, and loves walking and traveling. I took her on a short trip to a neighboring city where we hiked for two days, yet she remained energetic—gosh, she’s 81 years old! Still!</p><p>Besides, she has a great sense of boundaries and never judges or tries to control the way her kids and grandkids live. She understands that society is evolving quickly and admits that she might be a bit behind, so the best approach is to respect young people’s opinions and let them live their own way. And speaking of that, can you believe she’s illiterate and never had any formal education?</p><p>I wish I could have her passion and enthusiasm for life, facing challenges and defying turbulence in such a relentless way.</p><p>I met over 10 people this year, and among them, 6-7 became really close friends. I tried a live chat room but was quite disappointed by the Chinese guys there (arrogant as always). So, I moved to Bumble BFF mode and made a really good friend who even invited me to a Christmas party with locals only. The other friends I made came through networking—this is the advantage of being around and knowing extroverts; you meet one, and you meet them all. I was so surprised that I made so many real friends and had quality time with them. I truly appreciate the time they spent with me. Let’s share love, care, and calories!</p><p>I’m still not the type of person who tends to confront conflicts. I filter people instead of giving lectures. However, I’ve learned to react in the moment, rather than spending too much time reliving and analyzing a situation before responding. I admit that I place feelings ahead of judgment. In real-life experiences, I’ve found that, in certain situations, I simply cannot speak freely around people I feel uneasy with. On the other hand, with people I feel comfortable around, I become more creative and my ideas flow. Acknowledging the existence of these vibes has made it much easier to make new friends. If someone makes me feel uncomfortable, I leave. I believe there will always be a comfort zone for me, rather than sticking with the wrong people.</p><p>Overall, the degree of mental conflicts has decreased a lot this year, perhaps because I made so many good friends, and their involvement in my life kept me too busy to dwell on unnecessary thoughts. To be honest, even when I was alone in the evenings, I found myself watching series recommended by my extroverted friends…</p><h2><span id="mindsetk">Mindset</span><a href="#mindsetk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>One of the best mindsets I learned this year is to stop deliberately immersing myself in things of secondary importance and simply take action. From my childhood, I was always taught and disciplined to treat little things with great care, even when they were completely unnecessary. I used to plan perfectly before making any moves and once get sidetracked, trying to get back on track with the original plan. Now, I take the first step and adjust as progress unfolds. Practice is the best learning experience, and by doing so, I found that fears and anxieties disappeared, and what I once anticipated as insurmountable turned out to be not threatening at all. Also, the “do it for 5 minutes only” approach has been a great way to fight procrastination — once I started, I found the task wasn’t troublesome at all, and I enjoyed it.</p><p>A similar thing this year is that I also confronted rumination and learned not to get lost in it. I used to believe every problem had to be solved, but after reading the book <em>Overcoming Unwanted Intrusive Thoughts</em>, I realized sometimes it’s just an intrusive thought, and the best thing to do is ignore it. Focusing on the present and what’s most important has made a big difference. With the help of pistachio ice cream, salami pizza, Thai massages, and spending time with my favorite person, I’ve managed to unwind and stay relaxed. The power of rumination can be strong, and even though I tried, I still focused too much on bad memories. I’m still working hard to shake them off. Maybe this is a random walk, but as long as I keep walking, change will come.</p><p>Another mindset I like is not to fear bad things, as good things will follow to restore internal balance. I’m grateful for all the kind people I’ve met this year — you’ve truly lit up my life.</p><h2><span id="skillset-amp-learning-curvek">Skillset &amp; Learning curve</span><a href="#skillset-amp-learning-curvek" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>One of the best skills I learned this year was building this blog website using a blog framework, with the help of my friend <a href="https://sgzerolc.github.io/sg/about/">Sam Li</a>. Initially, I just wanted to create something fun because I enjoy coding and building new things. However, I never expected it to be so useful and to become one of my major achievements of the year. I motivated myself to have more inputs and outputs to showcase on the website, which became a strong driving force for creating more content. I also sought my friends’ opinions and used their photos as illustrations, which helped me connect with them even more.</p><p>From a reading perspective, I finished 6 books this year and am still reading 2, all of which are fictional. Compared to over 30 books last year, this is still a lot, especially since one of the books I’m reading is extremely long (around 4 million Chinese characters, taking over 100 hours to finish). However, focusing solely on the number of books or hours doesn’t tell the full story.</p><p>The most valuable book I read this year was <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/36989959/">Did Miss Zhu Fall Into a Trap Today?</a>, which I really enjoyed as a piece of electronic literature (网文). It’s an intriguing story about a woman who disguises herself as a man and thrives in a political environment where women are discouraged from receiving an education and are not allowed to work. She becomes a completely self-made woman and eventually rises to the position of prime minister. Once in power, she reveals her true identity as a woman, resigns, and becomes a landowner in one of the country’s regions. I was surprised by the quality of this literature and felt motivated by the protagonist’s journey. It reminded me that just getting started and focusing on solving problems can lead to transformative change.</p><p>I wanted to take more courses on Coursera, but due to some drama, my subscription was canceled. So, I went back to DataCamp for the Data Engineering and Data Science tracks. The engineering courses were quite boring, so I paused them and focused on the Data Science ones instead. These courses have been really helpful in building step-by-step knowledge, especially since I never learned Python systematically back in university. The courses, along with the practice sessions, allow me to learn from scratch and truly understand the “how” after grasping the “what.” I love the sequence of learning lists, arrays, dictionaries, and data frames. I’m still struggling with slicing and selection, but I’m confident I’ll get the hang of it soon. In the near future, I plan to leverage the databases on Kaggle and work on more data analysis projects, which I’ll post on this website.</p><p>I have always been a huge fan of AI like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot, using them for refining my writing, fixing coding errors, scheduling my day, and more. Inspired by some Reddit users, I decided to create a digital version of myself. I input statistics about myself, including personality test results, life experiences, and key self-comments regarding important decisions in my life. Then, I trained the model and refined the outcome. This process allowed me to understand myself better by asking the model questions. There were many useful prompts that helped me gain insights, such as “sum up my core question in life.” This aided in my self-reflection and provided direction for self-development, inspiring me to think in multiple directions. It’s not about finding a machine to replace my own thinking but rather finding a digital friend who can imitate my thought process and inspire deeper questions.</p><p>The last habit I developed is using Google Calendar to write my diary. I’ve been journaling since I was five and always enjoyed it, but moving frequently made paper diaries impractical. After trying various tools like Evernote, Notion, Notability, and Apple Notes, I decided to simplify the process by using Google Calendar events to log my achievements. This way, I can combine what happened that day with my feelings in one place. It’s incredibly useful for writing my year-end review, as I can easily browse my calendar and read about what happened throughout the year.</p><h2><span id="the-personal-touchk">The Personal Touch</span><a href="#the-personal-touchk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><ol><li><h3><span id="snowuaryk">Snowuary</span><a href="#snowuaryk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><img src="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/jan.jpg" class title="jan"><p>Foggy Budapest, where I returned home after a solo celebration of my biggest exam success.</p></li><li><h3><span id="shortest-monthk">Shortest Month</span><a href="#shortest-monthk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><img src="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/feb.jpg" class title="feb"><p>My best friend Cat moved to the Netherlands, and we had our last Afternoon Tea at IKEA, a place we used to frequent a lot when we were both at university.</p></li><li><h3><span id="spring-awakensk">Spring Awakens</span><a href="#spring-awakensk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><img src="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/march.JPG" class title="march"><p>From my friend @j_s_joyce, who always takes amazing photos and now serves as my primary photographer for the website.</p></li><li><h3><span id="blossom-monthk">Blossom Month</span><a href="#blossom-monthk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><img src="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/april.JPG" class title="april"><p>Cotton candy in the sky.</p></li><li><h3><span id="may-flowersk">May Flowers</span><a href="#may-flowersk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><img src="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/may.JPG" class title="may"><p>Travelling with my grandma.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>三月的时候就想写篇吐槽文把这件事写个完整。总结经验教训以免以后又接到这种锅。沉舟侧畔千帆过，回想起来心里还是苦苦的：是不是每个人看上去生活得都很光鲜？揭开袍子全是蟑螂跳蚤和虱子？🤮</p><p>我21年10月入职时心里全是侥幸，薪水低又被新加坡团队（以后再写一篇文章吐槽）磋磨全都忍了，只想在国外躺平，心想哪怕是金融行业也该有个灰尘堆角落让我眠一眠吧。当时在做这项工作的米奇把这个工作交给我，一开始非常简单，周三早上收到市场评论然后上传到红橡树，发邮件请合规团队注意审阅，然后一个白天的时间会经过三个地区的法律合规部门传递，最后发给纽约的某位director进行终审就结束了。如果下午到我的下班时间（一般5-6点）还没结束，交给位于亚特兰大的凯兰接力。我这么尽心尽力的性格一般会搞到整个任务结束，不管多晚，只有到睡觉时间了才会让凯兰接手。</p><p>其实我这种太负责的性格，一开始就埋下了地雷。这项任务<strong>没有</strong>任何技术含量，纯粹是行政性事务，做得再好也不会有什么闪光点。我只是太年轻太自卑，觉得自己没有一技之长，有什么就先接着，做着做着就有高级任务了。</p><p>后来凯兰加了一项新任务，周四的时候把已经盖章的评论文件在eloqua平台再次编辑，通过Jira发送指令，让eloqua团队审核文件是否合规，最后以邮件形式发送到上千名客户邮箱里。</p><p>其实周四任务也没什么问题，因为21-22年初那时审核非常宽松，不会揪住一个问题不放，客户只想看评论内容，你的排版和免责声明谁在乎？</p><p>我当时还觉得这项工作轻松又赚印象分，一直写在我的贡献项里面。2022年6月作者罗宾逊辞职了，轻松6个月。</p><p>再后来就是12月从高盛招了新的作者林楠，头衔是宏观经济研究部部长。当时第一次聊天只觉得她非常活跃，打破砂锅问到底，没有高层人士沉稳的气质，经常秒回信息，说很多感谢的话语，<strong>好像</strong>比罗宾逊好相处很多。</p><p>后来的经历证明，我的感觉一半对一半错。</p><p>林楠不是埋头苦干的老实人，自己的内容输出不能只赚辛苦钱，一定要扩大影响力。她本人不惹事也不怕事，一定要把这项每周事务做得尽善尽美。于是灾难来了。</p><p>首先是评论的最终展现方式，此前是复制粘贴截图到邮件里再发出去，方便但不美观。JG提出可以用公司新引进的技术GLS，加上纽约市场营销团队的大力支持，我要学习如何生成GLS，这项任务嵌入在红橡树里面，第一次试验就遭遇惨败：不知道为何，我没法把任务发送给business approver</p><p>于是此后半年我一直拜托GLS专门的技术人士艾丽卡，请她每周四生成GLS链接给我。</p><p>其次就是这项任务的急迫性一下子上来了，本来一天结束次发出去也差不多，结果林楠开始密切关注红橡树进展。她对自己写作内容的大量宣传使得全球各个办公室的销售和关系经理密切关注这项任务，我每周都会接到新的请求，在这项评论文件的推广地区选项加入新的国家。有次我们加入了科威特，当地的合规部门完全契合了中东的工作风气，不回消息，不解释为什么要如此修改文件，我们耽搁了一整天；第二天林楠打电话给这种合规部的同事，她居然敢不接managing direcoter的电话。</p><p>伦敦的合规部主导者很会做人做事，一番讨论下来，以后这项任务在红橡树上不必经过三个地区，除非有新的国家地区加入要求添加当地合规部的审批意见，只走EMEA（即主发起人）即可。这项提议极大地减少了作业时间和我的心理压力。我的内耗实在太严重了，好像怎么样都不行，如果自己吃瘪会痛苦，如果压别人一头愧疚感也会把我拽进地狱。</p><p>然后新的enhancement又来了，大量客户要求添加自己的邮箱到收件列表中。在GLS之外，我加了一项新的任务，某天，加拿大营销团队的克里斯蒂娜在我快下班时问我知不知道teamworld和mail-code，想不想学。本着东亚人谦逊的性格，我接了电话学了点新技术。剪除了每周需要更新客户清单的投入，但她的介入使另一个麻烦精联系到我成为可能。</p><p>接到路易斯电话的时候我并不觉得奇怪，这项任务人人都想沾光，而且这位同事的态度比纽约的阿丽娜好太多了，后者永远都在对我颐指气使，好像我是她的小厮。况且，我并不熟悉HTML，如果能多个人指导一下怎么推进也是好的。路易斯的介入使得Eloqua地图变得更加复杂，从原本的一个分支变为三个，工作任务增加两倍。</p><p>此外，本来的设计是客户收到邮件后点链接，转入PDF网页，路易斯又加了一步，设计了一个网页来展现评论的summary，然后再点链接进入PDF网页。我不需要参与新网页的设计，但是他们的动作太慢，总是耽误整体的项目进程。</p><p>所以从第二季度开始，到12月，我的周四和周五总是100%打起精神，全面检测这项任务。尽管多数时候我已经做到尽善尽美了，但因为别人的失误和一拍脑袋，这项任务要推倒重来。我还没有办法清清静静地来，需要跟对方解释，为什么这么做不对，为什么我们需要走这个步骤。</p><p>大概第一季度结束的时候黑彼得知道了这件事，本来是俄罗斯人告密朝我泼脏水，结果他知道了一定要管一管。预约了会议准备谈一谈，林楠的性格是睚眦必报的，大清早给他打了电话，并且把他举报给了自己的上司。黑彼得也不是忍气吞声的，他觉得我完全可以胜任更有技术含量的工作，而且哪能吃瘪，所以一直密谋把这项工作撤掉。</p><p>一个非常大的情绪爆发是八月末准备3Q市场评论，我自己摸索着重新设计了Eloqua的邮件样式，结果被Jira团队疯狂挑问题，当时在备考CFA二级，本来就心情不好，朝对方发了几句泄愤的话，然后立马下线看了三天的小说。说到这里我真是非常怂，连别人的回应都不敢看。再上线的时候，发现其实对方还不如我，我只要强硬起来，对方立马就软了。</p><p>我为什么不跟林楠举报这件事？因为没用，她发起飙来不仅没法解决我的问题，反而会破坏我好不容易建立起来的关系。在这点上，林楠跟黑彼得并没有什么区别，**解决问题让自己爽了，不用管别人的死活。**包括后来的大件货珍妮弗也是这样，可能高层领导都有这样的气质才能成功🤮</p><p>就这样熬到了12月放假，期间听说林楠非常喜欢我，可能把我招到她的团队，我当时有点兴奋，居然以为自己真的要写评论而不是做行政事务了。后来证明还好我没跳坑，一来我没法去到美国，二来我大概率会继续做行政事务，林楠的团队永远不会把真正重要的撰写任务交给我。</p><p>（我真的厌恶营销团队，同时完全理解他们啃到了林楠这块大蛋糕，投入产出100%转化，对增加曝光度和事业推进帮助非常大。）</p><p>这样对比下来，比起我入职时的培训：</p><ol><li>整体时间敏感度变高</li><li>GLS技术的引入使得这项任务变得更不能出错。</li><li>Eloqua编辑平台对HTML技术要求很高，动不动就要学习编辑文字和插入链接。</li><li>Jira团队实在太多事了，一点小事就要上纲上线。</li><li>除了每周任务，还有每季度的两项任务，要求100%全身心监控和秒回要求，令人身心俱疲。</li><li>市场营销团队像饥肠辘辘的秃鹫，永远都在想着优化的点子然后要求我去落实。</li></ol><p>（这样一想，乐观来说，如果我连这种事务都能忍受，那么去做前台产品策略跑客户还真是小菜一碟）</p><p>再后来，终于有了好消息，林楠不断地追捕全球COO负责人使其烦不胜烦，终于指派了EMEA区域的COO团队从我手里接手这项工作，一位叫阿妮莎的同事联系到我，我大概培训了她一个半月，她又在我的监督下实践了这项工作一个月，期间有摩擦但也看在面子上解决了。大概从2024年3月开始，我以为自己终于摆脱了这项工作，开始计划在中国的假期，并且畅想接下来的半年怎么利用空出来的，谁知道这件事还有后续：</p><p>我的领导凯兰辞职后，高层决定解散我的组，将整个liquid credit pod并入另一个组。我和同组同事被重新分派到固定收益部门，我加入了布达佩斯的团队，美国同事则归入亚特兰大的团队。好处是我重新回到了基金管理业务，坏处是我和美国同事格莱姆不再同属一个组，他由纽约团队管理，我由布达佩斯团队管理，尽管我们的工作仍紧密协作。</p><p>由于凯兰已经离开，重组活动又需要三个月的缓冲时间，珍妮弗成为了我的临时领导，没想到GCW这项任务居然又回到了我的桌上，并且持续发酵让我在高压下度过了重组成功前的最后一个半月。</p><p>本来在凯兰离开前，珍已经就这项任务跟我俩开过一次会，我在详细介绍并演示了这项任务后，三个人都同意这项任务不适合本部门再做，至少不应该由我继续做。接着，前面提过的EMEA COO团队的领导周先生找到珍妮佛，说我之前培训过的阿妮莎马上要离职了🙂临时找了两个做行政业务的同事接手这项工作，这两位同事并不了解这项工作，希望我能重返这项任务，给这两位同事必要的支持……</p><p>what the fuck? 如果这工作还留在我的组，交给了我的同组同事，我提供支持还说得过去。现在已经转移到了别的组，完全没有再跟这项工作牵扯上关系的必要，而且林楠的性格跟水蛭差不多，一旦扯上谁都会被狠狠吸血，哪怕汇报到公司最高层那里都要非很大的力气才能拔掉。</p><p>珍看热闹不怕事儿大，居然一口答应了。脑残。她找到我的时候说得特别好听，完全简化了事情的复杂程度，降低了严重性，只是说我在一旁观测两位同事南希和艾米，有什么问题我来回答就行。事实上，珍从来没有参与过这件任务，完全不了解GCW是个多么讨厌的老鼠屎。她太自以为是了，总以为自己无所不能，*一张巧嘴什么都含过，*任何事情都能迎刃而解，给我带来了灭顶之灾。</p><p>我答应帮忙的第一周从7.15开始，南希找到我的时候我就意识到她什么也不知道，阿妮莎可能是饱含怒火故意报复林楠，完全没让南希和艾米投入实践，只是分享屏幕大体演示了一下这项任务。于是我撑住一口气，暗暗诅咒了所有人一遍，培训了南希2个小时。培训完我一腔怒火狠狠压下去给珍写了小作文，预期很低，她也就说说漂亮话，但我一定要让她知道我的辛苦和无能为力。结果，她真的只是说了说好听的话，什么“有什么需要一定赶紧给我留言”，留言什么？她又不知道这项工作具体怎么做，到头来不还是我出力？傻屌。</p><p>培训完南希后我估计跟艾米的合作也不会愉快，她的任务更艰巨，时间敏感度更高。周四的时候艾米果然在我快下班的时候找到了，拜托我培训一下她，呵呵，不提前约我，我不会加班照顾你的。直接下班打游戏，并且做好了心理准备迎接可能的风暴。</p><p>果然，第二天珍给我发消息，说commentary没按时发出去，林楠大发雷霆，又把这件事层层上报，艾米的领导和上一级领导都被牵扯了进来。珍要求我写一份时间线汇报，告诉她从周二到周四都发生了什么，最好能按小时列出前因后果。我兴致上来了，很冷静地写了时间线。接着发现自己被拉进了一个会议，有艾米，南希，周先生，我和珍，还有林楠。</p><p>我很佩服有些人，他们好像天生缺乏自我反省的能力，永远外耗责怪别人，会议上大家一股脑安慰马上要爆哭的艾米，没人感激我额外花了时间培训别人和完成了第一周的工作。艾米说还是什么都不清楚，她完全不知道怎么做，看来是上周被林楠骂了个狗血淋头（该），我幸灾乐祸着，狗血撒到我头上来了：</p><p>珍让我把这项任务再详细化，变成每30分钟应该做什么，列一个时间线待办事项出来，“即使白痴如珍也能跟着照做”。于是我的噩梦来了，我从一个只需要回答问题的编外人员，变成了需要事无巨细照顾两个小婴儿的奶妈子。此时我的情绪已经非常低落，但努力地不带着情绪继续进行这项工作，并且预见到它只会越来越复杂。</p><p>第二周还是第三周的时候，额外的bug又出现了，阿妮莎应该是恨透了这项工作和林楠，在临走前故意留了个错误给我们，我接手之前一周的报告居然无法显示，客户想翻看这份历史报告，怎么也打不开了。</p><p>我在那天早早下班打游戏去了，第二天发现林楠下了追杀令，全江湖紧急搜捕我，大概有10封邮件密集提到我，问我这项错误是怎么回事，请我立马解决，又一次抄送了所有她能联系到的高层。我再一次WTF，为什么别人犯下的错误总是推我出来背锅？为什么我一个编外人员总是被人当成第一责任人？我读了teams群组所有消息，并且给了长长的回复把锅甩出去，他们还变本加厉要求我就这项错误继续培训南希和艾米，以绝后患。到这个时候我忽然意识到所有人都把我当救命稻草了，而我好学又负责的性格只会让我越陷越深，比如阿妮莎留的这个坑，我其实完全不知道怎么解决，完全是凭着一腔热情花了半天时间才找到的解决办法，但是所有人都觉得我应该负责以及我一定能解决，这就非常可笑了。</p><p>在这个时候，重组活动已经在进行中了，我也开始跟新的部门领导每周谈话，沟通我的工作进展。并且详细抱怨了GCW这项工作。我的初衷是希望新领导明白我的处境，我已经自顾不暇，我已经付出了很多，所以不要想着再给我安排新工作。后来他还真的帮上了我的忙。</p><p>到我接受GCW的第四周，艾米和南希已经基本熟练，期间我还跟珍在办公室见面，她也带来了一些进展，据说艾米一直在骚扰林楠，希望自己不再经手这项工作；从每天要读的teams群消息我也能推断出来，找一个接手的人并不容易，很难就这项任务再开一个head count。到这个时点我对珍已经颇有微词：人前一套背后一套，当着大家面给你甩脸子，背后再捧笑脸；自己永远巧舌如簧，转化成行动全是你的工作要做，然后事情成了再美美地把所有的功劳抢走，深藏功与名，留给你的只是“yeah like I said you are a talent”之类的画大饼。<strong>殖人走狗风范</strong>。</p><p>到9月份，部门重组终于完成，我开始投入到新的团队中。本以为这件事可以让我喘一口气，顺便写完这篇吐槽文，谁知道居然还有后续🤡珍有一天忽然打电话给我，说自己又一次揽下了这个活儿🙄希望我能帮忙培训新人……</p><p>我已经无处发泄我的怒火😂她是怎么厚着脸皮命令我，一个不再是她下属的人进行一项毫无好处的工作的？我秒拒绝了，于是她立马换了张脸，怒目而视威胁我“you better sleep on it and give me an updated answer tomorrow”她说我现在所属部门的全球领导人跟林楠关系非常好，林楠很有可能去摆脱这位领导层层施压，最后到我manager和我的头上，大家撕破脸就不好看了；接着又画饼，说很可能要在伦敦开一个岗位专门做这项工作，对我而言是非常好的换城市机会。我哭笑不得，这狗逼完全没意识到这种无聊的工作是对我技能树的巨大浪费，而且我没有软弱和无能到因为她一句话就继续跪舔跟她一样当狗。</p><p>你个傻屌以为我是被吓大的？</p><p>挂了电话我就找新领导反映情况，请他护犊子继续往上反馈，说我烦不胜烦，忍无可忍，希望高层能考虑下这件事，至少上一级领导能知道这项任务的存在，不至于一直被蒙在鼓里直到被一棒子打个懵逼。新领导动作很快，联系到上一层的领导之后，让我写了邮件说明这项工作的始末，我很清楚地阐述了自己是怎么被一而再再而三地卷入这项工作的，也隐晦指出一直是珍在我和林楠之间传递消息，很有可能是珍自作主张要说服我继续进行这项工作，这样她就能持续收割好处；以我对林楠的了解，她虽然偏爱死缠烂打，但绝对不会黑白不分，我换组了就是换了，她不会再骚扰我。</p><p>上一级领导又给我打了一个电话，确定了一些细节，然后就由他出面跟进去了。有了上级领导的承诺和安抚，这件事终于平息了，就算再起风波我也不怕了，我总是有破釜沉舟的勇气的，实在不行我就辞职，给所有人一个教训。最后的一点小插曲就是珍再次跟我见面，吐槽了林楠，说林楠非常霸道强势，她替我高兴终于不用跟林楠一起工作了。我差点就信了🙂林楠在上级领导给我打电话的当天就留言给我，感谢我付出的一切，说她很确定我在2月培训阿妮莎的时候就做了全面明确的交接，我的完成度是完美的；接着她说，如果<strong>再有人</strong>敢骚扰我让我圈进这项工作，一定要告诉她，她会保护我，帮我处理。谁光明磊落谁是伪君子一见分晓。</p><p>**珍是个大件货。**呵呵</p><p>终于迎来了尾声，写到这里我的情绪也差不多有了出口。期间有笑有泪有哭泣，我学到的东西：</p><ol><li>如果一项工作是持续性的，接手之前一定细想它是不是你的职责。</li><li>如果总有人吆五喝六让你干着干那，I don’t have capacity 永远是最好的回答。实在不行就辞职呗，我的情绪健康永远最重要。</li><li>说了做了就别后悔，做了永远比不做强。减少内耗，干就是了。</li><li>如果空有好心和能力就是我为鱼肉，你所有的周全和替别人考虑都会变成别人毫无内疚刺向你的利剑。要么废柴，要么有能力又mean</li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3><span id="my-current">My current</span><a href="#my-current" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><p>For more than three years I cover fixed-income funds that were previously part of ACP (Alternatives Client platform). Last year during Summer time recognizing a better alignment with the Fixed Income Product Strategy team’s objectives, leadership transitioned me to this team. It’s more of a reporting line change as  my core responsibilities, the funds I cover, and the front-office teams I collaborate with (Lodon, New York and Singapore offices) remain the same.</p><p>My current  work focuses on fund reporting, including the update of fund pitchbooks and commentaries, completion of monthly and quarterly recurring reports from existing clients. I am also involved in ad-hoc requests from prospective clients, such as big RFPs to draw new money oppotunities.</p><h3><span id="my-master-s">My Master’s</span><a href="#my-master-s" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><p>My master’s program is in Business Analytics, with a strong focus on coding. The curriculum covers the full spectrum, from data analysis and data engineering to data science.</p><p>We learn to use statistical analysis to uncover patterns and evaluate the impact of past and future business decisions. Through coding, we apply predictive models and causal analysis to translate raw data into actionable insights.</p><p>The program also emphasizes practical skills like collecting, parsing, and processing data, as well as implementing these processes in production using key tools, frameworks, and platforms.</p><p>Beyond technical expertise, we’re trained to manage data-driven businesses, generate knowledge from big data, and present findings effectively. Collaboration is also a key aspect, as we often work with software developers, quantitative analysts, and other specialists to deliver clear and impactful analysis.&quot;</p><h3><span id="my-passion">My passion</span><a href="#my-passion" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><p><strong>Current Role and Desire for Growth:</strong><br><em>“Over the past three years, I’ve <strong>gained a solid foundation</strong> in fund reporting, and I’ve <strong>mastered</strong> the processes involved. Now, I’m eager to <strong>expand my horizons</strong> and <strong>take on new challenges</strong> that allow me to grow and apply my skills in innovative ways.”</em></p><p><strong>Desire for Advanced Data Analysis Work:</strong><br><em>“With my CFA Level II qualification and a master’s degree in Business Analytics, I’m excited to leverage my analytical expertise to <strong>dive deeper into advanced data analysis</strong> and insights generation. I’m particularly interested in <strong>projects that go beyond data wrangling</strong> and involve creating impactful, data-driven solutions.”</em></p><p><strong>Collaboration with Non-Technical Teams:</strong><br><em>“Working with a team without a tech background has taught me how to <strong>simplify complex concepts and collaborate effectively across diverse skill sets</strong>. While I’ve adjusted my approach to meet their needs, I’m excited to join an environment where I can fully utilize my technical capabilities and continue developing innovative solutions.”</em></p><h3><span id="my-achievement">My Achievement</span><a href="#my-achievement" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><p>At work, my projects vary depending on the programming language I use. For instance, I’ve done <strong>ATX-powered automation</strong> to streamline pitchbook updates. Using ATX, I pull data from BlackRock’s database on portfolio characteristics and returns, aggregate it with Excel formulas, and auto-update charts with a simple VBA click. This has saved us over 20 hours per month across 10+ pitchbooks.</p><p>I’ve also worked on <strong>ATP-based projects</strong> that involve pulling data from our database, cleaning it, and producing slides for pitchbooks or recurring client requests. A more advanced project was performance attribution against benchmarks—breaking it down by asset allocation, industry, credit rating, etc. I built a function to drill down into issuer-level insights under top-performing sectors or asset classes, helping PMs and clients understand where the outperformance is coming from. A lot of this was collaborative—Jordan helped me here, and that’s how we started building a great partnership.</p><p>On the <strong>Python side</strong>, I write scripts for data wrangling and analysis to support fund reporting. One example: I transformed a massive CSV with 14,000 records and 150+ fields into a client-friendly template. By building dictionaries to rename fields, rearrange columns, and align with the client’s requirements, I cut a 3-hour task down to 5 minutes. I also regularly update the script to incorporate PM feedback, reducing both time spent and human error.</p><hr><p>周五心态爆炸心想这工作我是一分钟也干不下去了，找人抱怨好像也无济于事，索性让Chat GPT给我列了一系列问题我来回答，帮忙分析我现在的情况。</p><h3><span id="1-your-current-feelingsp">1. <strong>Your Current Feelings</strong></span><a href="#1-your-current-feelingsp" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><ul><li><p>What specifically makes you unhappy about your job? Is it the work itself, the environment, the people, or something else?</p><p>我觉得工作要么钱多，要么工作有趣，要么有大量空余时间，至少占两样。现在一样没有我还是赶紧撤吧。工作本身我已经不再喜欢，环境太抠门了（年终聚会吃披萨，日常共享数据账号），有些人没法相处，我的同事有好多笨蛋。</p></li><li><p>Are you feeling burned out, unfulfilled, undervalued, or something different?</p><p>我的能力没有得到团队的认可，他们并不感激我的coding skill做出的贡献。他们总是想要从我这里获取更多，但是没问过我想要什么。我的团队的需求和我能提供的之间存在着巨大的mismatch 我常常觉得力不从心</p></li><li><p>When did you first start feeling unhappy, and has it been gradually building up or was there a triggering event?</p><p>从24年7月我的前任manager离开公司之后，我经历了两任新的领导，部门重组，被迫做并不属于我责任的事情。我的不满在不断积攒，终于在上周五一位纽约的MD不断追问我能不能接手一项任务之后彻底崩溃。</p></li></ul><h3><span id="2-your-job-rolep">2. <strong>Your Job Role</strong></span><a href="#2-your-job-rolep" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><ul><li><p>What do you currently do in your role, and what do you enjoy (if anything) about it?</p><p>我的职位是固定收益-产品策略，属于基金管理大组PMG, 主要负责某些高收益债券共同基金的路演材料制作、市场评论分析，已有客户的月度和季度报告撰写，也负责潜在客户的尽职调查报告填写。我并不需要参加客户会议，但是会议材料（比如基金收益状况说明和分析）需要我来完成。这是一个典型的中后台工作，以reporting为主。我喜欢的点在于能深入了解一个产品和市场，能跟前台的单位（比如基金管理团队和research团队）保持联系，写报告有时需要处理大量的数据，我的coding skill能提高效率，保质保量。</p></li><li><p>Do you feel your skills and talents are being utilized effectively?</p><p>并没有，写报告有太多复制粘贴的内容，尽管我已经考了CFA二级，但需要分析的地方太少，并且此类工作永远要在前台城市（纽约新加坡和伦敦）才真正有意义，否则只是读二手的新闻材料翻来覆去写三手的报告，我的部门的存在纯粹是因为布达佩斯这座城市劳动力低廉；我的coding skill并没有被团队珍惜，他们没有任何科技背景，总是异想天开，以为我用coding能更快地收集数据，他们完全不知道写一个脚本需要最初的草稿，经历测试和收集用户反馈，最终才能成型，这不是一个一蹴而就的过程。与我级别差不多的前台同事并不关心我的写代码本事，在他们看来能写完报告就好，并不在乎我是怎么写完的（因为他们不需要替代我工作），我的团队也不想学coding，他们更愿意手动完成工作，可能这样花更多时间更能显示出他们努力工作了。因此，我常常需要降级自己的技能来适配他们，因为如果我一旦完成了所有工作的自动化，那么所有的工作都要依赖我完成，在我休假的时候也没人替代我。</p></li><li><p>Is there something you’ve been wanting to do in your role but haven’t had the chance?</p><p>我不想仅仅为了处理数据写一个个小的脚本，我想做完成的数据科学或者数据工程项目。现在的工作对coding技能的要求太低，我的技能没有得到开发利用。</p></li></ul><h3><span id="3-work-environmentp">3. <strong>Work Environment</strong></span><a href="#3-work-environmentp" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><ul><li><p>How is the work culture? Do you get along with your colleagues and supervisors?</p><p>东家非常崇尚DEI，这一点还说得过去，但是放到日常细节上困难重重。I don’t feel attached to my team. 跟我有合作的中台同事分布在美国，他明显与纽约的前台更熟悉称兄道弟。伦敦团队现在满员并不是很需要我，我跟布达佩斯当地的同事没有任何共事的内容，一起开组会和吃中饭也没有任何工作话题能沟通。我的领导跟我相处只有三个多月的时间，他并不了解我的情况，况且我在布达佩斯的团队有20多人，他没有太多时间关注我一个人。</p></li><li><p>Do you feel supported by your team and management?</p><p>我对前台的同事完全没有亲切感，我更像是一台写报告的机器，无论是纽约、新加坡还是伦敦，我都没有任何归属感。纽约团队在我的晚饭时间布置团建活动，鼓励我参加，给纽约办公室的人定了披萨，没问我……到头来我需要饿着肚子一个人出现在视频上看大家吃披萨？我直接下线。我的布达佩斯同事因为没有共同的工作内容，沟通很少，加上团队人多座位少，我并没有机会坐在一起，因此更没机会沟通了。还有一点我觉得非常可笑，新的组预算非常有限，我之前的组很少会限制我的软件权限，在新的组里为了节省预算居然要取消我的MorningStar账号，并且至少三次要求我解释为什么我要用MorningStar；更可笑的是，我们整个组20多人，加上我只有2-3个MorningStar账号，常常有同事发消息拜托我上MorningStar下载数据，一个核心业务组居然窘迫到需要共享账号，这在我看来非常不可思议，要知道，我之前的小组6个人，每个人都有自己的账号。</p></li><li><p>Are you satisfied with the work-life balance or benefits provided?</p><p>从7月我的前任领导辞职开始，美国团队陆陆续续走了3个人，现在招了两个实习生来顶替走掉的4个高级经理的工作，太可笑了。我被迫全权承担了很多以前我只需要做一部分的工作，比如retail side的所有报告现在基本上都是我在写。有问题问了群里也很少有人回复我，跟多时候对方也没有答案，需要我自己去解决。每个季度结束后的第一个月我非常忙碌，完全没有工作平衡，我也没有得到任何补偿。</p></li></ul><h3><span id="4-career-goalsp">4. <strong>Career Goals</strong></span><a href="#4-career-goalsp" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><ul><li><p>Do you have a clear vision of what you want your career to look like?</p><p>我的人生没有非做不可的事，如果要加一系列标准，我希望这个工作：1.是项目导向而不是每月或者每季度循环生成的 2. 有大量的空余时间和学习机会，而不是紧跟市场随时应对 3. 能够长久居家办公 4. 我不想要成为领导者，喜欢一个人独立工作</p></li><li><p>Are there skills you want to develop or a specific field you’d like to explore?</p><p>我已经系统学过数据科学和数据工程的内容，也会用R Python和SQL的语言，需要继续锻炼写代码的能力，多在datacamp上课；同时提升表达能力，应对行为能力面试和情景分析。</p></li><li><p>Do you think this job aligns with your long-term goals?</p><p>显然没有。金融行业永远是前台最吃香，但我并不想离开欧洲。这个行业压力太大，我想要更多的工作生活平衡。</p></li></ul><h3><span id="5-options-for-changep">5. <strong>Options for Change</strong></span><a href="#5-options-for-changep" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><ul><li><p>Have you considered switching roles within your current company, or do you want to leave entirely?</p><p>内部转岗，找数据科学家的工作，积累1-2年经验，然后跳槽去别家。</p></li><li><p>Are you financially and emotionally ready to make a career change?</p><p>没有问题。</p></li><li><p>Do you know what type of job or industry might make you happier, or are you still figuring it out?</p><p>目前来看转码非常好。我不想再跟没有tech背景的人共事了</p></li></ul><h3><span id="6-support-systemp">6. <strong>Support System</strong></span><a href="#6-support-systemp" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><ul><li><p>How does your support system (friends, family, mentors) feel about your desire to change jobs?</p><p>都很鼓励。</p></li><li><p>Do you feel comfortable discussing your dissatisfaction with anyone at work, like a manager or HR?</p><p>已经在年终表现会议上跟manager提过。期初，我从来没收到过这么多的改进建议，我能理解前台的同时希望我更多投入到路演材料的制作和创意点子上，但我现在忙于复制粘贴，完全没有带宽想任何的改进措施。manager总是承诺好好好，这是一个长期的过程，将来会考虑招人。只有我的离开才能推动这个过程。</p></li><li><p>Are you worried about how this decision might impact your personal life?</p><p>在办公室进行此类谈话，冲突是不可避免的。我的朋友都很支持我，因此并不会影响个人生活。</p></li></ul><h3><span id="7-barriersp">7. <strong>Barriers</strong></span><a href="#7-barriersp" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><ul><li><p>What’s stopping you from making a change right now? Fear of failure, financial concerns, or lack of clarity?</p><p>工作太忙，没有时间看内部调岗的消息，也没有时间系统地学习，更没有心情。</p></li><li><p>Have you tried applying for new roles, or are you stuck on where to start?</p><p>还在观望内部职位</p></li><li><p>Are you open to further education, training, or certifications to pursue a new path?</p><p>已经在datacamp上进行数据科学家track的学习</p></li></ul><p>总结下来，我讨厌现在工作的点在于：</p><ol><li>相同的工作已经做了三年，无趣，没有任何成长空间和上升渠道。</li><li>团队人员的流失，更多的责任指向了我，而我的努力被当成理所当然。</li><li>我的队员没有任何人有写代码的技能，我必须要降低我的水平来适配他们。</li><li>新组的领导不了解我，也没有时间更多了解我。</li><li>新组预算紧张，甚至没有办公位，我非常厌恶账号共享和工作聚餐吃便宜食物。</li><li>我的薪水明显太低，coding skill没有得到充分利用，转码能有更多涨薪空间。</li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>有一段时间，我以为自己的周密考虑是我的优点，自豪自己善于把事情安排得井井有条。我总是能够制定出计划 B 到 Z，相信快乐来自于对生活的掌控。然而，当我出国读书工作后，遇到了一系列不顺心的事情。无论我如何反复分析，事情似乎总是朝着我不希望的方向发展。每次反思都让事态变得更糟，一些不愿意回忆的事情也浮现了出来，似乎在证明我的错误和失败，让我感到失控。直到最近，我才了解到“反刍”这个心理学名词，意思是反复咀嚼过去消极的回忆，或者不由自主地沉湎于不好的回忆之中。找了<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Unwanted-Intrusive-Thoughts-Frightening/dp/1626254346">一本评价还不错的书</a>开始读。</p><img src="/adventure-park/2024/04/28/rumination/IMG_7032-5288806.jpg" class title="IMG_7032-5288806"><p>首先，人人都有或暴力或色情的想法，你并不孤独，但多数人都对自己有这样的想法感到愧疚和自责而不愿意宣之于口。缺少专业的咨询师介入让倾诉这件事变得更加困难，找家人和朋友可能会让事情变得更糟。所以，关键的点在于，如何控制不由自主产生的想法，并且不让它们影响你的正常生活。</p><h2><span id="know-about-unwanted-intrusive-thoughtsk">Know about unwanted intrusive thoughts</span><a href="#know-about-unwanted-intrusive-thoughtsk" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>unwanted intrusive thoughts 是暂时的，但你越是拼命抵制，它越是难以快速散去。again产生这样那样的想法并不奇怪，但我们的应对办法可能出了问题。内心的声音分为三种：</p><ul><li>Worried Voice（“要是……了怎么办”）</li><li>False Comfort （由worried voice引发，通过接二连三的否定带来的虚假放松，但焦虑假设太多，此起彼伏无法完全消灭焦虑的声音，反而让焦虑越来越严重）</li><li>Wise Mind （冷静克制的旁观者，只关注当下。“Let them remain as thoughts”）</li></ul><p>作者举了一个🌰看见可爱的小猫咪产生了掐死它的想法。What you resist tend to persist.
