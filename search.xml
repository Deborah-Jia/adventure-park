        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/adventure-park/2025/04/08/cognitive_intervention/460951434_8026931937408127_232805312106331281_n.jpg" class title="460951434_8026931937408127_232805312106331281_n">最近我越来越确信，我的身体，会悄悄听我大脑的声音。<p>不是那种下定决心之后咬牙坚持的自律，而是一种细水长流的默契——就像你悄悄告诉猫咪“你可以跳上来”，它就真的跳了上来那样自然——那么自然，那么安心。</p><p>有一天我忽然意识到，最近总是食量暴增，可能是药物的副作用。那天晚上我没说什么、没定什么规矩，只是默默想了一下“啊，原来如此”。第二天开始，我竟然自然地没了胃口，不再想吃那么多了。身体像是收到了一张温柔的纸条，上面写着：“你已经知道原因了，那我们轻一点吧。”</p><p>还有一次，我开始用App记录每天的卡路里。刚一开始，那些曾经让我无法抗拒的食物，就突然之间变得不那么诱人了。它们没有变，但我变了。我脑子里一转念，身体就悄悄配合了。</p><p>有时候，这种默契也出现在其他地方。前阵子我迷上一款游戏，玩得很开心。可是某天我突然看透了它的“套路”，觉得这个游戏其实没什么意思，就失去了兴趣。没有勉强、没有挣扎，放下游戏，拿起书本，那一刻，我竟然觉得读书也好甜。</p><p>一月的时候，我告诉自己：“年度报告周期快到了，我得早点醒。”结果连续好多天，我都五点多自然醒来，头脑清醒，心也稳稳的。不需要闹钟，也不需要谁推我一把，好像身体知道：“你已经准备好了。”</p><p>我读到，这其实是一种叫“认知介入”（cognitive intervention）的现象。意识的转变引发了行为的转变，但它不是命令式的，而是身体与大脑默契的合奏。</p><p>情绪上也一样。前阵子，工作和生活中我都遭遇了让人心碎的事情。那几天我觉得灰心，好像努力总得不到回报。直到某天，我收到消息——那个曾让我遗憾错过的岗位，后来出了很严重的问题。而我，刚好避开了。那一刻，心情一下子就晴了。连那些原本让我伤心的事，也突然不重要了。不是反复自我安慰的结果，而是如夜雨停歇，天空自然放晴。</p><p>这一切让我越来越相信，<strong>我们的身体，其实很懂我们。</strong></p><p>当大脑完成了一次小小的“认知介入”，身体也会随之做出温柔的调整。它不会催促你、责怪你、拽你前行，而是默默地说：“你已经知道了，那我们就一起轻快一点吧。”</p><p>我很感激这种默契。它让我觉得，即使人生很多时候都在“走弯路”，但只要心和身体同频，就没有什么是真正白费的。</p><p>或许，成长就是从一件件这样的事里，学会温柔地和自己合作。这些身心同频的瞬间，不是面对自己时的苦斗，而是相信、觉察之后的水到渠成。</p><p>我开始在日记里悄悄记录这些“小奇迹”。我给这个系列起了个名字——<strong>“身体与我同频的瞬间”</strong>。像在黑夜里种下一盏一盏的灯，等未来回望的时候，就能看见那些光点，是如何温柔地照亮过我的人生。</p>]]></content>

      <title>我们仍未知道为何自那天起我成为了早起者</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/21/early_riser/458213960_1800323327321764_8760678151869770322_n.jpg" class title="458213960_1800323327321764_8760678151869770322_n"><p><strong>30年睡眠困扰的突破解法：意外的早睡早起体验</strong></p><p>在过去的二十多年里，我一直饱受睡眠问题的困扰。虽然不算是特别严重的问题，但入睡困难几乎贯穿了我的人生。从小学四五年级开始熬夜写作业，我就逐渐养成了晚睡的习惯（可惜没早起）。初中时熬夜看小说，高中熬夜学习，大学熬夜追剧和打电话谈恋爱，研究生期间熬夜内耗。工作后，熬夜的内容变成了思考一些有的没的。</p><p>偶尔，我会幸运地早起一次（5点到7点左右）。每到这种时候，心情都会瞬间愉悦，甚至感到自豪，比吃一顿大餐还高兴。然而，紧接着脑子就开始推送一些不太愉快的回忆和焦虑感，让人瞬间觉得人生无望。于是，我常常会在床上内耗1-2小时才真正起床。虽然一旦动起来心情会稍微好些，但清晨的情绪总是不太高。</p><p>为了解决早起的动力问题，我甚至尝试过用开心果牛角包来诱惑自己，想着“早起就能吃到这份美味”。然而，时间一长，这种方式的吸引力显然不足以持续。约会对象是位很温柔的男子，有他在会坚持把我所有的电子设备丢到起居室，然后监督我早睡，但我也不能总屈服于别人的意志来满足自己吧，可恶。</p><p>更多时候，虽然我晚上11点就躺下了，但可能因为接近满月，总感觉“狼人血脉觉醒”。忽然之间，干劲十足，人生充满希望，白天觉得压力山大的工作也变得不再可怕，甚至觉得自己能够轻松应对。脑子里冒出无数点子，比如和远方朋友互动的创意，越想越兴奋，结果根本睡不着。最后干脆爬起来把这些点子一一实践。</p><p>然而，熬夜的代价也很明显。熬夜适合做一些轻松的工作或学习，但如果是需要深度思考的任务，比如加班或攻克复杂问题，我就基本做不到。这导致了一个恶性循环——越熬夜越只能玩社交媒体，越觉得时间被浪费，越焦虑。</p><p>为了改变这种作息，我尝试了很多方法。吃褪黑素，刚开始有效，但时间一长似乎就形成了“耐药性”。增加运动量却发现，运动后反而兴奋得更睡不着，而且作为一名懒鬼，也不可能每天都运动。还试过通宵熬夜，让自己极度疲劳后强迫早睡，但这种方法效果微乎其微，事倍功半。无数次向家人和朋友抱怨，但她们作为资深早起者，除了“放宽心”这条万能建议，似乎也帮不上什么实质性的忙。</p><p>2024年年终总结时，我还特地写下了“要注意早睡早起”作为新年目标。然而2025年的开局并不顺利，作息直接变成了早上睡、下午起。我一度心灰意冷，觉得这辈子可能就这样了。</p><p><strong>意外的转机</strong></p><p>然而，就在我基本放弃的时候，转机悄然而至。</p><p>1月6日，节后上班的第一天。想到堆积如山的邮件，我随口跟自己说：“尽量早起吧。”并没有定什么严格的闹钟，11:30才关灯，自己也没指望能早起。但意外发生了——第二天早上，我竟然在6点前清醒地自然醒了！</p><p>这一切简直像是梦中排练过无数遍一样。我看了一会儿书（当时在读《山茶花文具店》），写了一些代码，然后起床泡茶、做了健康的早餐。当忙完这一切，抬头一看时间，居然还不到8点！到办公室时不到9点，我简直不敢相信——怎么能有这么美好的一天？我配拥有这样的生活吗？</p><p>当天晚上，居然不到9点就困了。于是，我听从身体的信号，立刻上床睡觉。第二天，依然不到6点自然醒！从此，我开启了早睡早起的节奏：读书、学习、做饭、喝茶，早早到办公室，生活变得如此充实有序。</p><p><strong>新生活的感悟</strong></p><p>到今天为止，这种作息已经持续了两周多。最早能5点起床，身体疲累时也能8点多起来，完全告别了中午才起床的日子。更神奇的是，我再也不需要药物或运动的辅助，晚上9点多自然困倦，轻松入睡。</p><p>早起带来的成就感让我受益匪浅：脑子更加清晰，有更多时间辨别进而专注于重要的事情，身体感觉越来越舒服，整个人也比以前更开朗自信了。回想起之前，我总觉得早睡早起是人生中最难的事情，一定要付出巨大的努力才能做到。但当它自然而然地发生时，反而觉得简单得不可思议。这或许就是2025年上天赐给我的开年礼物吧。</p><p>现在回头看，可能问题出在“太在意”这件事了。我把早睡早起当成了一个非做成不可的任务，反而让自己越睡不着。现在一切顺其自然，反倒水到渠成。所谓“心变念变感受变”，当你坦然接受一切时，很多事情就会自然而然地实现。</p><p>最近读到的一本书也提到类似的观点：不要把事情当成必须完成的任务，也不要硬撑着“坚持”。如果一件事需要消耗大量意志力才能完成，那离崩溃和失败可能也不远了。当你足够坦诚地面对自己并顺应自然规律时，心想事成反而会成为一种轻松的体验。</p><h4><span id="ba-hao-yun-qi-chuan-di-gei-da-jia">把好运气传递给大家</span><a href="#ba-hao-yun-qi-chuan-di-gei-da-jia" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h4><p>这种健康的作息已经无痛持续了两周，我很有信心继续保持下去。希望把这份高能量和好运气传递给每一位读到这里的朋友！新的一年，继续允许好事发生吧！</p>]]></content>

      <title>Chasing Flamingos and Sunsets: A Whimsical Weekend in Cyprus</title>
      <link href="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/"/>
      <url>/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/DSCF0008.JPG" class title="DSCF0008"><p>When Tanya asked me to join her for a weekend trip to Cyprus, I immediately said yes—much to both of our surprise. “How can you agree so quickly without knowing the cost, the plan, or… you’ve only known me for less than three months!” she exclaimed. “I don’t know,” I replied, “you seem passionate and reliable; besides, you don’t know me that well either, but you still asked.” That spontaneous exchange set the tone for our three-day, two-night adventure in Cyprus.</p><img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/DSCF0005.JPG" class title="DSCF0005"><p>We boarded the plane early on a chilly Saturday morning at Budapest Airport. The gloomy, biting cold made me curl into myself, shivering at every gust of air. So, when we landed in sunny Larnaca, the contrast couldn’t have been more dramatic. I immediately basked in the warm, endless sunlight and relished the 20°C temperature. It felt like a small miracle after the freezing start to the day. While waiting for the shuttle bus, we found ourselves distracted by playful cats—ubiquitous little sprites that seemed to exist in every corner of the island. These well-cared-for felines, adored by both locals and tourists, became an unexpected part of the charm.</p><img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/DSCF0136.JPG" class title="DSCF0136"><p>No trip to the Mediterranean is complete without indulging in the food, so as soon as we unpacked, we set out to find a great meal. Every restaurant looked tempting, with enticing aromas and vibrant menus, but we settled on one called <em>To Arxontikon</em>. Its charming architecture and the mouthwatering smell of freshly baked bread and stews drew us in. The staff greeted us warmly, instantly recognizing we were tourists, and enthusiastically recommended some of their most popular dishes. We ended up ordering a red meat platter and a beef stew.</p><img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/91744121392_.pic.jpg" class title="91744121392_.pic">The meal started with freshly baked brown bread, warm and impossibly delicious. But the real star was the stew. From the first bite, I couldn’t hold back: “F—, this is so good!” I blurted out. The flavors were rich, layered, and utterly satisfying. The beef was tender, infused with an incredible blend of herbs and natural ingredients that made it taste like something straight out of a Mediterranean dream. Served in a quaint little pot, it was as visually delightful as it was tasty. We devoured the meal like two hungry sharks, savoring every bite as though we hadn’t eaten in days.<img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/DSCF0016.JPG" class title="DSCF0016"><p>One of the highlights of Larnaca is flamingo watching. After our fantastic meal at Arxontikon, we took a leisurely stroll by the seaside, listening to the soothing calls of seagulls. Along the way, we explored the historic old castle and an ancient church before arriving at the salt lake.</p><img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/DSCF0079.JPG" class title="DSCF0079"><p>There they were—flamingos in all their glory! A sea of pink, like a cloud floating just above the water. Their honking filled the air as they gracefully dipped their heads to catch shrimp and fish. We even got lucky and found some delicate pink feathers scattered along the lakeside—a perfect little souvenir from this magical spot.</p><img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/DSCF0048.JPG" class title="DSCF0048"><p>On the second day, we hopped on an intercity bus to Paphos, another stunning coastal city with a slightly more modern feel. Being food lovers, we couldn’t resist heading to a well-known spot called Ocean Basket. We ordered the classic Soulmate Platter, paired with the finest local beer. The portions were enormous, the seafood fresh, and the aroma irresistible. As we watched the sunset paint the sea in fiery hues, we peeled shrimp, sipped our beers, and marveled at how perfect life can be in moments like these.</p><img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/DSCF0150.JPG" class title="DSCF0150">The hotel we booked in Paphos was another highlight—breathtaking sea views, a large swimming pool, and, of course, the local guardian cats strolling around as if they owned the place. On our final day in Cyprus, Tanya and I lounged by the seaside, soaking up the warm Mediterranean sun with the gentle companionship of a few curious cats.<img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/DSCF0178.JPG" class title="DSCF0178">If there was one downside to Cyprus, it would be the public transportation. Buses here seem to follow no schedule, and stop signs are practically non-existent. Routes can change without any warning, often due to local events. That said, the bus drivers more than made up for it with their friendliness and helpfulness. One kind driver even gave us a free ride, meaning, “Save that money for the airport—it’s on me.”<img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/DSCF0018.JPG" class title="DSCF0018"><p>As I reflected on the trip, a curious cat seemed to ask me what I had taken away from this adventure. I answered (in my head, of course) that as a social animal, I truly enjoy traveling with others. This trip taught me not just to enjoy good company but also to be thoughtful and considerate of others along the way.<img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/20/CyprusTripDiary/DSCF0207.JPG" class title="DSCF0207"></p>]]></content>

      <title>Creating My AI Self: A Journey of Reflection, Growth, and Practicality</title>
      <link href="/adventure-park/2025/01/04/AI-know-myself/"/>
      <url>/adventure-park/2025/01/04/AI-know-myself/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/04/AI-know-myself/111735978543_.pic.jpg" class title="111735978543_.pic"><p>For a while now, I’ve been curious about using AI for purposes beyond just translation, code fixes, or scheduling tasks. After reading <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/674c117600000000070242c4?source=webshare&amp;xhsshare=pc_web&amp;xsec_token=ABplDKnxPnE-1w-49FvT_oxalAYNYlCtW0yrkBgJPNc5k=&amp;xsec_source=pc_share">an inspiring post</a>, I decided to take the plunge and create a digital version of myself.</p><p>The idea is straightforward: I feed in meaningful information about my life experiences—like where and how I grew up, the programs I studied, key people in my life and their impact, major decisions I’ve made and how they’ve shaped my present, reflections on pivotal moments, personality test results (e.g., MBTI and Big Five), and my current life goals, among other things.</p><p>A critical reminder is to <em>NEVER</em> share confidential information like addresses, financial details, passwords, or anything you wouldn’t want to become public. (Though no one’s likely to care that pistachio is my favorite ice cream flavor or that I despise donuts.)</p><p>Here’s a useful tip: I instructed ChatGPT to reply only with “Copy that” for all my inputs. Once I’m done adding the information and need its help, I give it new prompts for analysis or insights. This way, it won’t interrupt me with unnecessary commentary while I’m still building my digital self.</p><img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/04/AI-know-myself/WeChatcf508d65372a273d946469137ec18380.jpg" class title="A simplified process"><p>Initially, I wanted to gather as many inputs as possible before asking for any analysis. But after some second thoughts, I decided to take a different approach: why not let it refine its results through practice and corrections? So, I started asking multiple questions and providing feedback along the way. These included:</p><ul><li>What can be a meaningful success for me in your opinion?</li><li>What assumptions do you think I regularly make about myself, others or the world, a nd how might they limit me?</li><li>Based on my ambition and values, what is one action that you think I should start taking now that I havn’t?</li><li>What is one area of growth that you think I overlook or resist?</li><li>What is one risk I’m willing to take for personal growth in the near future?</li><li>…</li></ul><p>These questions were inspired by a deep dive on Reddit, but you can always create your own to suit your specific needs or curiosity.</p><p>One of the most striking answers I received was to the question:  “if you could sum up my ‘core question’ - the driving inquiry of my life or personality - what would it be?”</p><p>It says “<strong>How can I overcome my circumstances, achieve meaningful success, and create a life where I feel fulfilled, appreciated, and in control of my own destiny?</strong>”</p><p>Oh my gosh, I literally sniffed back tears. This answer hit me so hard—it’s exactly what I’ve always pondered but never had the chance (or clarity) to articulate so succinctly.</p><p>However, there are some obvious drawbacks. At times, it gets stuck “hamster-wheeling” around my experiences without offering anything new, occasionally even repeating what I’ve already mentioned. My solution is to provide it with more precise feedback and deeper thoughts so it can update itself accordingly. Another challenge is the limitation on the length of each chat—figuring out how to save its memory and transition seamlessly to a new chat has become a new hurdle to overcome.</p><p>I’ve also received some constructive feedback from friends and peers. Some of them question whether I’m using AI as a substitute for my own independent thinking. While I appreciate this perspective, I disagree. The purpose of creating an AI version of myself is to simplify processes and serve as an auxiliary tool, not as a replacement for my judgment. I’ll never rely solely on AI’s conclusions to make final decisions; it’s a complement, not a crutch.</p><p>(to be continued…)</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>🕒 <strong>Estimated Read Time: 18 minutes</strong></p><p>This year has been tremendous for me, with many unexpected changes—both welcome and unwelcome. I was pushed to stop overthinking or planning too far ahead and instead focus on living in the moment, prioritizing what truly matters, addressing issues quickly, and leaving analysis and reflection for later. I was also fortunate to make a wonderful group of new friends, with whom I shared many enthusiastic and meaningful conversations. This helped me open my heart and become more open-minded. Looking back, I gained so much but also lost some. As we say in Chinese, what you gain is what you deserve, and what you lose is what was never meant to be yours. 2025, I am ready.</p><h2><span id="life-amp-experiencek">Life &amp; Experience</span><a href="#life-amp-experiencek" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>The first and most meaningful experience this year was passing the CFA Level II exam in January. I cried and called my mom as soon as I saw the result. Thinking I had failed, she tried really hard to comfort me. Then I said, “No, I passed! I’m just too thrilled.” The last time I cried like that was when I found out I got into my high school, lol. It wasn’t just about the exam result—it was about proving to myself that I can overcome challenges and accomplish difficult things. I deeply value the sense of achievement and personal growth that came from this journey, as it was rooted in self-reflection and mindfulness.</p><p>At the same time, I made an important decision to stop studying for Level III, as I’ve decided not to pursue a career in finance in the foreseeable future. While the industry is undoubtedly attractive, I’ve realized it’s not the right path for me. With this decision, I resumed studying data science, began practicing regularly, and started exploring ideas for data analysis projects on Kaggle.</p><p>I resumed traveling this year. My last job required me to travel frequently, and for a while, I thought it would be better to stay at home. However, I really enjoyed my trip to Vienna, which gave me the chance to unwind, especially when I met so many interesting people and experienced unexpected surprises. I still remember the photographer’s son, a stranger, and another little boy we met when she took a photo of me. A friend once told me that I always make new friends wherever I go.</p><p>Playing video games on a console was another new experience for me this year. I was under a lot of stress this Spring, and my friend convinced me to give video games a try. Initially, I was resistant, largely due to the toxic and ignorant mindset I’d encountered in the past, which labeled video games as pointless. But why must everything we do be meaningful? Who defines what is joyful? I ended up buying an Xbox Series S and subscribing to Xbox Game Pass for six months. Out of all the games I played, Assassin’s Creed Origins became my favorite, followed closely by Hitman 47 Deluxe Edition. I enjoy games that require strategy to outsmart enemies rather than just confronting and killing them—this feels very much in line with my personality.</p><p>I started dating again and met my favorite person (so far). We’ve had a lot of meaningful conversations, and he’s a great listener—at least, he tries to be open-minded. Together, we’ve hunted for <a href="https://budapestflow.com/hidden-mini-statues-budapest/">mini statues</a> around Budapest and traveled as well. My friends said that being in a romantic relationship completely changed me from Amy to Bernadette. I laughed and refuted that, saying, “You folks never knew me before, lol.”</p><p>The biggest (yet unexpected) takeaway this year was the positive decision regarding my permanent residence. I didn’t expect it to come so soon. Gaining PR has given me more vocational flexibility and the freedom to choose where I want to live.</p><p>Compared to the start of this year, I’m clearly happier (many thanks to my dearest friends again) and no longer feel the Sunday blues. I hope that next year, I can continue spending time with all these wonderful friends, enjoying good food, art, and museums together in Europe.</p><p>(Gosh, I still feel like I’ll never finish this year-end review…)</p><h2><span id="health-amp-lifestylek">Health &amp; Lifestyle</span><a href="#health-amp-lifestylek" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>I still felt stressed over low-probability things this year. First, I worried too much about my cavities, then about the potential failure of a dental surgery, even though I live in a city known as the dental capital of Europe. In the end, the surgery was very successful, and I didn’t even feel any pain after the anesthetic wore off (I’ve started to appreciate local public care a bit more). Then, I spent a lot of time worrying about abdominal pain, which immediately cleared up when I went home for the holidays (probably caused by an unhealthy lifestyle). In early December, I worried excessively about another health issue, which turned out to be completely unfounded. All in all, my unhealthy lifestyle made me feel bad, which led to emotional stress and worsened the situation. I didn’t even realize this vicious cycle until I wrote it all down.</p><p>Eating and sleeping well remain a challenge for me, unfortunately. I’ve kept up the bad habit of staying up late (sometimes all night), waking around noon, and repeating the cycle the next day. Because of this poor sleep routine, I often skip breakfast or even lunch, leaving me with just one meal most days. While I’m still young and healthy—only catching one cold each winter and recovering without medication—this lifestyle undoubtedly poses health risks if it continues. The only consolation is that my sleep quality is excellent. Once I’m asleep, I can easily enjoy 8+ uninterrupted hours. Still, I hope to adopt a better schedule, going to bed before 11 PM and waking up early around 7 AM.</p><p>In May, I had my annual health check and a few gynecological exams later in the year, all of which returned good results. It seems I’ve inherited excellent genes from the women in my family. From discussions with my doctors, I’ve learned that health is influenced most by family history, allergies, lifestyle choices (like coffee, smoking, and drinking), and exercise. I’m determined to keep up the positive habits.</p><p>This year, I didn’t develop a habit of frequent exercise. I’ve lost the stamina to jog, which I used to have in my early 20s. To regain it, I started taking daily long walks, setting a calorie-burning goal on Apple Fitness. Some days it worked, and other days it didn’t, depending on how much free time I had or whether someone joined me. It also helped when there was an event to make the walk more engaging, rather than just random strolling. I particularly cherish moments of aimless chats with friends while walking along the Duna riverbank.</p><p>Body weight, along with BMI, is a reliable health indicator, and mine fluctuated a lot this year. After completing the CFA Level II exam, I indulged in Chinese restaurants, which led to weight gain. My weight peaked during my trip back to China, thanks to homemade food, bubble tea, snacks, and my grandma’s worry that I wasn’t eating well abroad. However, having my wisdom tooth removed forced a brief period of dietary restraint, and later, skipping meals helped me shed the extra pounds. Somehow, I managed to lose 33 pounds, reaching a relatively healthier BMI of 25.5.</p><p>New year, new me!</p><h2><span id="mental-amp-emotionk">Mental &amp; Emotion</span><a href="#mental-amp-emotionk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>As a typical HSP (Highly Sensitive Person), I tend to care too much about others and my environment, often at the expense of focusing on myself. I’m easily impacted by the words, facial expressions, and behaviors of those around me. I once thought it would be best to lock myself at home and focus solely on my own matters, but studying for an exam over the past two years only worsened the situation. Being isolated from society made me more sensitive and less sensible.</p><p>I sometimes wonder, am I really an introvert? I enjoy small-scale social events most of the time, and I’m energized by giving public speeches. My dark humor always makes people laugh (one friend even says his first amusement of the day always comes from my WeChat Moments #微信朋友圈). I took the MBTI test again and discovered that I’ve shifted from ISTJ (the Logistician) to ENFJ (Protagonist). Interestingly, I often get different results depending on the language used for the test and my location, whether inside or outside China. Perhaps my friend, who is also an ENFJ, has influenced me as well.</p><p>Work brought me the most emotional turmoil this year: one was the unexpected team turnover, and the other was being forced to get involved in an unwanted task. My problem is that I can be too considerate and kind to people who don’t appreciate it. <em>A man’s wealth is his own ruin by causing others’ greed.</em> I’m not the type to complain often, especially when all I want is emotional support. Once I start to repeat myself, it means I’m seeking a real solution and want to tackle the issue seriously. Through these two major situations, I realized that the best way for me to calm down is to do what I can, ask for help if necessary, and not to anticipate too much about the future. So, I’m learning to say no without feeling guilty, and I’ve made two strides toward this at the end of the year. It was difficult when I was going through it, but later on, I felt no shame at all and thanked myself for that insistence. I may be slow to react, but I do react.</p><p>One positive change I experienced this year is that I finally admitted I’m one of the normal people who can sometimes feel or fear loneliness. In the past, I always denied its existence and judged others who acknowledged it or did silly things to cure their sense of loneliness. It’s okay to feel lonely, and I’m fortunate enough to have made many new friends with whom I’ve had deep conversations. They’re like dandelion seeds, scattering in the backyard of my garden, bringing me endless joy.</p><p>They say that happiness comes from comparison, and I never doubted it. But with whom? One of my friends surprised me with his thoughts and made me feel guilty when he said he’s happy with his friends’ success. He’s right. <em>The true nobility lies in being superior to your previous self.</em> Focusing too much on other people’s seemingly superior lives will only drown you. It’s just a landscape.</p><h2><span id="interpersonalk">Interpersonal</span><a href="#interpersonalk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>My mom bought a new flat in the city, so this year I finally had the chance to spend plenty of quality time with my grandma. My grandma embodies all the amazing traits of her generation in China: sanguine, industrious, never complaining, and cherishing family. She is incredibly hardworking—waking up at 5 AM to cook, waking me up for breakfast, washing all the dishes, hand-washing the clothes, walking out to buy groceries, and then continuing with the chores. In the evening, she heads out to the square for group dancing, where she effortlessly makes new friends. She’s so easygoing and resourceful—sometimes she ends up meeting new people by chance, and before we know it, both of us are getting to know the neighborhood in the most unexpected ways.</p><p>My grandma loves fried chicken (both wings and nuggets!), burgers, enjoys bubble tea, and loves walking and traveling. I took her on a short trip to a neighboring city where we hiked for two days, yet she remained energetic—gosh, she’s 81 years old! Still!</p><p>Besides, she has a great sense of boundaries and never judges or tries to control the way her kids and grandkids live. She understands that society is evolving quickly and admits that she might be a bit behind, so the best approach is to respect young people’s opinions and let them live their own way. And speaking of that, can you believe she’s illiterate and never had any formal education?</p><p>I wish I could have her passion and enthusiasm for life, facing challenges and defying turbulence in such a relentless way.</p><p>I met over 10 people this year, and among them, 6-7 became really close friends. I tried a live chat room but was quite disappointed by the Chinese guys there (arrogant as always). So, I moved to Bumble BFF mode and made a really good friend who even invited me to a Christmas party with locals only. The other friends I made came through networking—this is the advantage of being around and knowing extroverts; you meet one, and you meet them all. I was so surprised that I made so many real friends and had quality time with them. I truly appreciate the time they spent with me. Let’s share love, care, and calories!</p><p>I’m still not the type of person who tends to confront conflicts. I filter people instead of giving lectures. However, I’ve learned to react in the moment, rather than spending too much time reliving and analyzing a situation before responding. I admit that I place feelings ahead of judgment. In real-life experiences, I’ve found that, in certain situations, I simply cannot speak freely around people I feel uneasy with. On the other hand, with people I feel comfortable around, I become more creative and my ideas flow. Acknowledging the existence of these vibes has made it much easier to make new friends. If someone makes me feel uncomfortable, I leave. I believe there will always be a comfort zone for me, rather than sticking with the wrong people.</p><p>Overall, the degree of mental conflicts has decreased a lot this year, perhaps because I made so many good friends, and their involvement in my life kept me too busy to dwell on unnecessary thoughts. To be honest, even when I was alone in the evenings, I found myself watching series recommended by my extroverted friends…</p><h2><span id="mindsetk">Mindset</span><a href="#mindsetk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>One of the best mindsets I learned this year is to stop deliberately immersing myself in things of secondary importance and simply take action. From my childhood, I was always taught and disciplined to treat little things with great care, even when they were completely unnecessary. I used to plan perfectly before making any moves and once get sidetracked, trying to get back on track with the original plan. Now, I take the first step and adjust as progress unfolds. Practice is the best learning experience, and by doing so, I found that fears and anxieties disappeared, and what I once anticipated as insurmountable turned out to be not threatening at all. Also, the “do it for 5 minutes only” approach has been a great way to fight procrastination — once I started, I found the task wasn’t troublesome at all, and I enjoyed it.</p><p>A similar thing this year is that I also confronted rumination and learned not to get lost in it. I used to believe every problem had to be solved, but after reading the book <em>Overcoming Unwanted Intrusive Thoughts</em>, I realized sometimes it’s just an intrusive thought, and the best thing to do is ignore it. Focusing on the present and what’s most important has made a big difference. With the help of pistachio ice cream, salami pizza, Thai massages, and spending time with my favorite person, I’ve managed to unwind and stay relaxed. The power of rumination can be strong, and even though I tried, I still focused too much on bad memories. I’m still working hard to shake them off. Maybe this is a random walk, but as long as I keep walking, change will come.</p><p>Another mindset I like is not to fear bad things, as good things will follow to restore internal balance. I’m grateful for all the kind people I’ve met this year — you’ve truly lit up my life.</p><h2><span id="skillset-amp-learning-curvek">Skillset &amp; Learning curve</span><a href="#skillset-amp-learning-curvek" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><p>One of the best skills I learned this year was building this blog website using a blog framework, with the help of my friend <a href="https://sgzerolc.github.io/sg/about/">Sam Li</a>. Initially, I just wanted to create something fun because I enjoy coding and building new things. However, I never expected it to be so useful and to become one of my major achievements of the year. I motivated myself to have more inputs and outputs to showcase on the website, which became a strong driving force for creating more content. I also sought my friends’ opinions and used their photos as illustrations, which helped me connect with them even more.</p><p>From a reading perspective, I finished 6 books this year and am still reading 2, all of which are fictional. Compared to over 30 books last year, this is still a lot, especially since one of the books I’m reading is extremely long (around 4 million Chinese characters, taking over 100 hours to finish). However, focusing solely on the number of books or hours doesn’t tell the full story.</p><p>The most valuable book I read this year was <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/36989959/">Did Miss Zhu Fall Into a Trap Today?</a>, which I really enjoyed as a piece of electronic literature (网文). It’s an intriguing story about a woman who disguises herself as a man and thrives in a political environment where women are discouraged from receiving an education and are not allowed to work. She becomes a completely self-made woman and eventually rises to the position of prime minister. Once in power, she reveals her true identity as a woman, resigns, and becomes a landowner in one of the country’s regions. I was surprised by the quality of this literature and felt motivated by the protagonist’s journey. It reminded me that just getting started and focusing on solving problems can lead to transformative change.</p><p>I wanted to take more courses on Coursera, but due to some drama, my subscription was canceled. So, I went back to DataCamp for the Data Engineering and Data Science tracks. The engineering courses were quite boring, so I paused them and focused on the Data Science ones instead. These courses have been really helpful in building step-by-step knowledge, especially since I never learned Python systematically back in university. The courses, along with the practice sessions, allow me to learn from scratch and truly understand the “how” after grasping the “what.” I love the sequence of learning lists, arrays, dictionaries, and data frames. I’m still struggling with slicing and selection, but I’m confident I’ll get the hang of it soon. In the near future, I plan to leverage the databases on Kaggle and work on more data analysis projects, which I’ll post on this website.</p><p>I have always been a huge fan of AI like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot, using them for refining my writing, fixing coding errors, scheduling my day, and more. Inspired by some Reddit users, I decided to create a digital version of myself. I input statistics about myself, including personality test results, life experiences, and key self-comments regarding important decisions in my life. Then, I trained the model and refined the outcome. This process allowed me to understand myself better by asking the model questions. There were many useful prompts that helped me gain insights, such as “sum up my core question in life.” This aided in my self-reflection and provided direction for self-development, inspiring me to think in multiple directions. It’s not about finding a machine to replace my own thinking but rather finding a digital friend who can imitate my thought process and inspire deeper questions.</p><p>The last habit I developed is using Google Calendar to write my diary. I’ve been journaling since I was five and always enjoyed it, but moving frequently made paper diaries impractical. After trying various tools like Evernote, Notion, Notability, and Apple Notes, I decided to simplify the process by using Google Calendar events to log my achievements. This way, I can combine what happened that day with my feelings in one place. It’s incredibly useful for writing my year-end review, as I can easily browse my calendar and read about what happened throughout the year.</p><h2><span id="the-personal-touchk">The Personal Touch</span><a href="#the-personal-touchk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h2><ol><li><h3><span id="snowuaryk">Snowuary</span><a href="#snowuaryk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><img src="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/jan.jpg" class title="jan"><p>Foggy Budapest, where I returned home after a solo celebration of my biggest exam success.</p></li><li><h3><span id="shortest-monthk">Shortest Month</span><a href="#shortest-monthk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><img src="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/feb.jpg" class title="feb"><p>My best friend Cat moved to the Netherlands, and we had our last Afternoon Tea at IKEA, a place we used to frequent a lot when we were both at university.</p></li><li><h3><span id="spring-awakensk">Spring Awakens</span><a href="#spring-awakensk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><img src="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/march.JPG" class title="march"><p>From my friend @j_s_joyce, who always takes amazing photos and now serves as my primary photographer for the website.</p></li><li><h3><span id="blossom-monthk">Blossom Month</span><a href="#blossom-monthk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><img src="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/april.JPG" class title="april"><p>Cotton candy in the sky.</p></li><li><h3><span id="may-flowersk">May Flowers</span><a href="#may-flowersk" class="header-anchor">ᡣ𐭩</a></h3><img src="/adventure-park/2024/12/27/2024AYearInReview/may.JPG" class title="may"><p>Travelling with my grandma.
