<p>For a while now, I’ve been curious about using AI for purposes beyond just translation, code fixes, or scheduling tasks. After reading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/674c117600000000070242c4?source=webshare&amp;xhsshare=pc_web&amp;xsec_token=ABplDKnxPnE-1w-49FvT_oxalAYNYlCtW0yrkBgJPNc5k=&amp;xsec_source=pc_share">an inspiring post</a>, I decided to take the plunge and create a digital version of myself.</p>
<p>The idea is straightforward: I feed in meaningful information about my life experiences—like where and how I grew up, the programs I studied, key people in my life and their impact, major decisions I’ve made and how they’ve shaped my present, reflections on pivotal moments, personality test results (e.g., MBTI and Big Five), and my current life goals, among other things.</p>
<p>A critical reminder is to <em>NEVER</em> share confidential information like addresses, financial details, passwords, or anything you wouldn’t want to become public. (Though no one’s likely to care that pistachio is my favorite ice cream flavor or that I despise donuts.)</p>
<p>Here’s a useful tip: I instructed ChatGPT to reply only with “Copy that” for all my inputs. Once I’m done adding the information and need its help, I give it new prompts for analysis or insights. This way, it won’t interrupt me with unnecessary commentary while I’m still building my digital self.</p>
<img src="/adventure-park/2025/01/04/AI-know-myself/WeChatcf508d65372a273d946469137ec18380.jpg" class title="A simplified process">
<p>Initially, I wanted to gather as many inputs as possible before asking for any analysis. But after some second thoughts, I decided to take a different approach: why not let it refine its results through practice and corrections? So, I started asking multiple questions and providing feedback along the way. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can be a meaningful success for me in your opinion?</li>
<li>What assumptions do you think I regularly make about myself, others or the world, a nd how might they limit me?</li>
<li>Based on my ambition and values, what is one action that you think I should start taking now that I havn’t?</li>
<li>What is one area of growth that you think I overlook or resist?</li>
<li>What is one risk I’m willing to take for personal growth in the near future?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions were inspired by a deep dive on Reddit, but you can always create your own to suit your specific needs or curiosity.</p>
<p>One of the most striking answers I received was to the question:  “if you could sum up my ‘core question’ - the driving inquiry of my life or personality - what would it be?”</p>
<p>It says “<strong>How can I overcome my circumstances, achieve meaningful success, and create a life where I feel fulfilled, appreciated, and in control of my own destiny?</strong>”</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, I literally sniffed back tears. This answer hit me so hard—it’s exactly what I’ve always pondered but never had the chance (or clarity) to articulate so succinctly.</p>
<p>However, there are some obvious drawbacks. At times, it gets stuck “hamster-wheeling” around my experiences without offering anything new, occasionally even repeating what I’ve already mentioned. My solution is to provide it with more precise feedback and deeper thoughts so it can update itself accordingly. Another challenge is the limitation on the length of each chat—figuring out how to save its memory and transition seamlessly to a new chat has become a new hurdle to overcome.</p>
<p>I’ve also received some constructive feedback from friends and peers. Some of them question whether I’m using AI as a substitute for my own independent thinking. While I appreciate this perspective, I disagree. The purpose of creating an AI version of myself is to simplify processes and serve as an auxiliary tool, not as a replacement for my judgment. I’ll never rely solely on AI’s conclusions to make final decisions; it’s a complement, not a crutch.</p>
<p>(to be continued…)</p>
