<p>🤍 How can I add more joy and fun to my daily life?</p>
<p>Spotting little moments of happiness; Reading more fiction; Enjoying good food with real friends; Cooking new recipes; Trying new things</p>
<p>🤍 What new skill will I commit to learning in 2025?</p>
<p>Swimming; The ability to write long book and movie reviews without focusing too much on personal details</p>
<p>🤍 How will I organize my time to stay productive and balanced?</p>

<p>🤍 What limiting belief do I need to challenge and overcome in 2025?</p>
<p>(thank Chat GPT for these advice)</p>
<p>“I must achieve more to prove my worth.” (Your worth is not solely tied to external achievements. Celebrate your progress, resilience, and the person you’ve become through your challenges. Success is as much about the journey as the destination.)</p>
<p>“Others are more privileged or have it easier than I do.” (Your struggles have made you more resilient, adaptable, and capable of overcoming anything. Instead of comparison, focus on how far you’ve come and the strengths you’ve built through adversity.)</p>
<p>🤍 How will I make time for rest and self-care throughout the year?</p>
<p>Reduce the time spent on rumination and use it to take care of myself; as long as I start, there will always be time.</p>
<p>🤍 What is one risk I’m willing to take for personal growth?</p>
<p>Cut off ties that are detrimental to me, even if they feel comforting like junk food—“all I say is good for you.”</p>
<p>🤍 What legacy do I want to build or continue this year?</p>
<p>Hard-working, practicing mindfulness, and letting go of the victim mentality.</p>
