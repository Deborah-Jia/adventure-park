<p>These past two days, I am still in the process of digesting the news that I PASSED. I passed on my first attempt, surpassing all other candidates, which came as a complete surprise. During and after the exam, I was deeply disappointed with my performance and was convinced I would definitely fail. I was only pretending to be strong to give myself some psychological comfort.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the case. I passed, and I accepted everyone’s congratulations, kind words, and even jealousy. Why did I pass? Was it because the exam was all multiple-choice questions and I was just lucky? No. I passed with a strong score: two subjects with full marks and six above 70%. Then why was I still so disappointed and so harsh on myself?</p>
<p>Because I have always lived in a harsh world with intense competition. I was trained to believe that nobody remembers second place, and that you must always push yourself to win and impress others. I enjoyed two days of rest after I joined the top firm, and the last time I had anything similar was in kindergarten. In primary and middle school, I had to attend after-school classes. In high school, I had only one day of rest each month, spent doing laundry and buying daily necessities. I cut my wrist and forced myself not to eat as punishment whenever I didn’t get a satisfactory exam score.</p>
<p>I did my best and became completely exhausted throughout my three years of high school, with no TV or internet for relaxation. I achieved a score good enough to get into a top 10–15 university in China, in almost any program I wanted. But I ended up in a top 200 university. Why?</p>
<p>The enrollment system is flawed and unfair. I had only one plan, and I fell off the list. Some people were simply lucky and got into top universities with much lower scores than mine. As a first-generation college student in my family, no one knew what college was like. I had no real choice but to go. Dropping out and retaking the national exam was never an option.</p>
<p>Then my life completely changed—arguably, deteriorated.</p>
<img src="/adventure-park/2024/01/19/1st_thought_after_passing/EFB488BA-7E3E-4E60-BA88-603C590D8382_1_102_a.jpeg" class title="EFB488BA-7E3E-4E60-BA88-603C590D8382_1_102_a">
<p>An average school offers average education and average peers. I was verbally attacked simply because I was smarter than others, which made them feel threatened. My English was even better than the teachers’; one of them often asked me to translate the English textbooks, which only made other students feel worse. I was exhausted. After graduation, I couldn’t find a job.</p>
<p>I used to think this was just life—mine and everyone else’s. Unfair, but something you have to accept. In 2016, the year I graduated, I failed all three major exams: the national entrance exam for a master’s degree, the interpreting certificate exam, and the certified accountant exam. I almost accepted that I wasn’t as smart as I thought I was. Then came 2020. I passed IELTS and GMAT, and then CFA Level I with a global top 10% result.</p>
<p>Why did life suddenly become easier? Why could I suddenly achieve so much? Simply because I changed my track. I am done competing with Chinese candidates.</p>
<p>So it was never that I wasn’t hardworking, or that the exams were too difficult. It was that the competition was fierce and I was never in a privileged position. Your efforts do pay off—as long as you are in the right place.</p>
<p>That’s why I became curious about how far I can go by pushing myself further and seeing whether I can pass Level III in a less painful way. If the environment is fair, I am not afraid of the pain of hard work. The pain of regret hurts more. My life is already ten times easier than that of my 16-year-old high school self.</p>
