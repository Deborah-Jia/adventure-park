<p>This is a tremendus year for me with so many unexpected (wanted or not) changes for me. I was pushed not to think too much or plan for the long-term, but rather live at the moment, focus on what is important, fix it asap and leave the analysis &amp; rumination to a later stage. I was also lucky enough to make a bunch of new friends, with whom I had so many common and enthusiastic topics with and I opened my heart and become so open-minded. looking back, I gained so much but also lost some. As we say in Chinese, those gained are what you deserve and lost are those that doesn’t belong to you.</p>
<h2><span id="health-amp-lifestyle">Health &amp; Lifestyle</span><a href="#health-amp-lifestyle" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2>
<p>feel sorry to say but eating &amp; sleeping well remains a problem for me. I maintained the awful habit of staying up late (or the whole night), getting up around noon and it repeats itself the next day. Due to this poor sleeping habit, I always skip breakfast or even lunch, so most of the time I only had one meal. I am still young so I am still heathy, catching one cold each winter and can get healed with no medicine. But if I constantly have this poor lifestyle there is always sickness potential. The only comfort is that my sleeping quality is awsome as always, 8+ hours with no interruptin is never a problem. I sitll hope that I can be at bed before 11PM and get bed early around 7 AM.</p>
<p>This year I still didn’t form the habit of requent exercise. I lost the capability to jog from the ealy 20s. so to recover it I started talking a long walk every day, by setting a caloriy buring daily goal on Apple Fitness. It worked sometimes and sometime didn’t, mostly depending on my freetime and if I was accompnied by someone else. Also it helps if there are fine events insted of just radom walking. I really enjoy the moments when I chat aimlessly with my friends while walking by the Duna riverbank, and finding mini statues through every corner of the city.</p>
<p>body weight, along with BMI can be a realible indicator of health. I gained some weight after finishing CFA level II exam and spending relentlessly in Chinese restaurant. And my body weight reached a record high after I went back to China for home visit. Homemade food, bubble tea, snacks, my grandma’s concern that I was starving overseas, yum. Luckily, having wisdom tooth pulled gave me back some days of abstinence. and later on skipping meals helped me scale down many of my weights. I magically lost 33 pounds, reahcing a relavantly heathier BMI of 25.5. New year new me, still need to work hard on this.</p>
<p>The annual health check happened in May and I did several gyganchologist check later on, all with good result. Looks like I got some really good genes from the female side of my family. From the consultation with my doctors, it looks like family sickness history, allegies, lifestyle (coffee, smoke &amp; drinking) and exercise are the predominant factors of health status. keep it up.</p>
<p>For the concerns of teeth health, skin aging and body weight, I cut down sugar intake this year, and with the encouragement of my friend Shengshifu, I even reduced deep fried food. I hope next year I will focus more on homemade salad and seafood. As mentioned by her, one of my good traits is that I really have a light flavor of meals and I avoid putting too much salt in food. Keep it up.</p>
<p>Next year, hope I can become an early riser (11-7), eat healthier food and do more jogging.</p>
<h2><span id="mental-amp-emotion">Mental &amp; Emotion</span><a href="#mental-amp-emotion" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a typical HSP, I always care way too much about others and the environment instead of focuing on myself. I was easily impacted by the words, facial expression and behaviors of people around me. I once thought it would be good if I lock myself at home and focus on personal business, but in the past 2 years studying for an exam deteriorated the situation. Being isolated from the society only made myself more sensitive and less sensible.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder, am I a real introverted? I enjoy small scale social events most of the time, and I am energized by giving public speaking. My dark humor always makes people laugh (one friend even say that his first amusement of the day always comes from my Wechat Moments #微信朋友圈). I did the MBTI test again and found out that I changed from ISTJ (the Logistician) to ENFJ (Protagonist). Interestingly, I always get different result depending on the languge used for the test and my location inside or outside China. Perhaps my friend also impacted me as she is also ENFJ.</p>
<p>but overall, the degress of mental conflicts decreased a lot this year, pehaps because I made way too many good friends and their involvement in my life gets me too busy to conduct any unnecessary mindfulness. To be honest, evening being alone I was watching the series recommended by my extroverted friends.</p>
<p>As a person who is always learning how to be kind to myself and love myself more, I am always on the road to self-exploration. The path is spiral and I keep rising. One biggest achievement this year is that I confronted rumination and tried not to get dorwned in it. I used to believe that every problrm that pomps up needs to be solved, by reading the book <em>rumination</em> I realized sometimes it’s just an intrusive thought and all I need to do is to ignore. Just keep going and focus on the present and the most important. With the help of pitachio ice cream, salami pizza, Thai massage and spending time with my favorite person, I am mostly relaxed and sucessfully unwind. Here I am grateful for all the kind people I have met this year. You lit my lives.</p>
